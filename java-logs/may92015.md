===========
TIL that you can't overload the + operator in Java
TIL that Float.toString(float-number-here) will cast the float as a string without converting all numbers in the string to floats, as well.
samples:
'''
 
float f = Float.parseFloat("25");
String s = Float.toString(25.0f);

As a side note, if you wish to compare two float/strings, convert both to floats first, then compare.

TIL that new String will not create a comparable string. Still checking if there's a comparable way to compare two strings created as new String, but if you want to compare them later on, use myString = "my string here" without invoking the new string method.
