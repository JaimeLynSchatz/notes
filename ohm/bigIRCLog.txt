[Monday, June 02, 2014] [12:02:46 PM] <muninn-project>	Man.
[Monday, June 02, 2014] [12:02:57 PM] <muninn-project>	Today is exhausting ,e
[Monday, June 02, 2014] [12:03:28 PM] <jlschatz>	muninn-project: :/ it sounds like it!
[Monday, June 02, 2014] [12:05:25 PM] <muninn-project>	jlschatz: Did you get the dataa you neeed?
[Monday, June 02, 2014] [12:05:48 PM] <jlschatz>	muninn-project: sort of. 
[Monday, June 02, 2014] [12:06:29 PM] <jlschatz>	muninn-project: I've got the right template and I can brute-force close to what I want onto the site, but it's a hack job and not really the correct way
[Monday, June 02, 2014] [12:06:59 PM] <jlschatz>	muninn-project: which then makes the template not able to load the correct js scripts from themmusictree.net
[Monday, June 02, 2014] [12:07:11 PM] <jlschatz>	muninn-project: but i'm going to keep trying
[Monday, June 02, 2014] [12:08:40 PM] <muninn-project>	Ok, what error/ issue is keeping you back?
[Monday, June 02, 2014] [12:09:35 PM] <jlschatz>	Right now, I've got a div just sort of wedged in to the layouts/_search.html.erb template
[Monday, June 02, 2014] [12:09:55 PM] <jlschatz>	muninn-project: It makes what I want show on the page but 1. I know that's not the right way to do it
[Monday, June 02, 2014] [12:10:27 PM] <jlschatz>	muninn-project: and 2. because it's not the right way to do it, Rails isn't loading the main.js and slider.js that the TimeSlider depends on.
[Monday, June 02, 2014] [12:10:40 PM] <jlschatz>	muninn-project: at least, that's what I think is happening. :/
[Monday, June 02, 2014] [12:11:29 PM] <muninn-project>	jlschatz: ARe you getting a crosss site scripting exception?
[Monday, June 02, 2014] [12:12:16 PM] <jlschatz>	muninn-project: no exceptions. the styles and functionality just aren't being attached to the slider. 
[Monday, June 02, 2014] [12:13:12 PM] <jlschatz>	muninn-project: I played around with it in my own browser before slicing out the css and trying to get it into the template, so it works by itself.
[Monday, June 02, 2014] [12:13:36 PM] <muninn-project>	Is it loading the files?
[Monday, June 02, 2014] [12:15:25 PM] <jlschatz>	muninn-project: I don't think so, but I'm looking again. When I put the <script> tag right in the template (the gods cried) it came up in red, 404'd. Looking again, though, to try to find it
[Monday, June 02, 2014] [12:16:14 PM] <muninn-project>	ok. That's a lead.
[Monday, June 02, 2014] [12:17:54 PM] <jlschatz>	muninn-project: not finding it. it's not loading the css, either - inspect element only shows the common.css file. :/ I'll keep digging.
[Monday, June 02, 2014] [12:19:02 PM] <muninn-project>	jlschatz: what does the network trace say? Wrong url requrested?
[Monday, June 02, 2014] [12:21:38 PM] <jlschatz>	muninn-project: it's not even listed in the table of files requested. I'm not requesting it. ( 
[Monday, June 02, 2014] [12:21:52 PM] <jlschatz>	muninn-project: trying something else...
[Monday, June 02, 2014] [12:22:14 PM] <muninn-project>	?! er. ok. What does the raw source look llike?
[Monday, June 02, 2014] [12:25:31 PM] <jlschatz>	https://gist.github.com/JaimeLynSchatz/e868f7d053d0cd8b8cda
[Monday, June 02, 2014] [12:37:20 PM] <jlschatz>	muninn-project: I feel like I'm missing something really, really obvious. Am I going about this the wrong way - should I let Rails do more of the work and generate the TimeSlider as a controller insead and take it from there? (Will that let me add the files, or add the content of the files) in such a way that Rails knows where everything is?
[Monday, June 02, 2014] [12:38:10 PM] <jlschatz>	muninn-project: I started this way as a kind of proof-of-concept to make sure it would work in the first place but it's clearly not. And I worry that I'm wasting time fighting this.
[Monday, June 02, 2014] [12:38:41 PM] <muninn-project>	What is the benefit of having the code in rails versus on the client side?
[Monday, June 02, 2014] [12:39:00 PM] <muninn-project>	The primary use of the slider is to pass on the variable to the tile url
[Monday, June 02, 2014] [12:39:12 PM] <muninn-project>	Who loads tiles? java script or rals
[Monday, June 02, 2014] [12:39:58 PM] <jlschatz>	muninn-project: I'm still figuring that part out. (to state the obvious, sorry)
[Monday, June 02, 2014] [12:41:09 PM] <muninn-project>	From what I ermemnber, it's in JS land.
[Monday, June 02, 2014] [12:41:29 PM] <jlschatz>	muninn-project: ok. 
[Monday, June 02, 2014] [12:41:45 PM] <muninn-project>	thus it might be bettter to have it in js from the get go.
[Monday, June 02, 2014] [12:41:59 PM] <jlschatz>	muninn-project: back to the drawing board. Let me clear some windows and tackle it from the other side :)
[Monday, June 02, 2014] [12:42:02 PM] <muninn-project>	So, the other qiestion is, what benefit is there to have it in rails?
[Monday, June 02, 2014] [12:42:10 PM] <muninn-project>	(If any?)
[Monday, June 02, 2014] [12:42:20 PM] <jlschatz>	muninn-project: I thought it had to be in rails in order for it to be visible on the site
[Monday, June 02, 2014] [12:42:39 PM] <jlschatz>	muninn-project: I clearly don't understand how the site architecture yet. 
[Monday, June 02, 2014] [12:43:01 PM] <muninn-project>	Rails generates a lot of the JS / HTML. But you can just insert a hack in to the html to load your own JS/
[Monday, June 02, 2014] [12:43:09 PM] <muninn-project>	OK. Take the time to learn it.
[Monday, June 02, 2014] [12:44:21 PM] <jlschatz>	muninn-project: Ok. Let me see what I can figure out here. I was hoping to have at least visible on the site by the end of the day today but I can see that's not going to happen.
[Monday, June 02, 2014] [12:44:43 PM] <jlschatz>	muninn-project: *have the slider visible on the site. Yeay, typos.
[Monday, June 02, 2014] [12:48:18 PM] <muninn-project>	!
[Monday, June 02, 2014] [12:50:48 PM] <jlschatz>	muninn-project: I've been at this since a little after 5 today. I'm going to grab a little caffeine and jump bakc in. Typos are my canary in the mine.

[Tuesday, June 03, 2014] [12:27:05 PM] <jlschatz>	Does grep actually work for finding phrases or variable names in a directory of files? I'm searching for where "$sidebarWidth" is set and coming up empty. Grep just kind of hangs and Google's not helping finding it in public repos.
[Tuesday, June 03, 2014] [12:29:38 PM] <muninn-project>	grep "\$sidebarWidth" [filelist]
[Tuesday, June 03, 2014] [12:29:43 PM] <muninn-project>	You have ot escape the $
[Tuesday, June 03, 2014] [12:29:51 PM] <muninn-project>	or else it thinks its a shell variable.

[Wednesday, June 04, 2014] [09:04:24 AM] <jlschatz>	muninn-project: just an update, got the date fields to show on the page but the sliders that dynamically load aren't loading. I thought it was becuase of an error I was getting but I solved that and the sliders half still aren't loading. I'm still at it, going to try a few more things.
[Wednesday, June 04, 2014] [09:25:11 AM] <muninn-project>	Have you tried loading it in an iphone or a another browser?
[Wednesday, June 04, 2014] [09:25:25 AM] <muninn-project>	THey break differently, might give you a better idea.
[Wednesday, June 04, 2014] [09:26:17 AM] <jlschatz>	I'm bouncing between Chrome and Firefox right now - they're each giving me different info. It's still on localhost, so I don't know if I can load it on my phone.
[Wednesday, June 04, 2014] [09:26:36 AM] <muninn-project>	HuMMMmMMmmM
[Wednesday, June 04, 2014] [09:27:12 AM] <muninn-project>	Is the loading created by a javascript or a css elemnt?
[Wednesday, June 04, 2014] [09:30:28 AM] <jlschatz>	muninn-project: if I'm reading this properly, the sliders themselves are in javascript: 
[Wednesday, June 04, 2014] [09:30:28 AM] <jlschatz>	    this.$outer = createDiv("ticker-nub-outer", control.$el);
[Wednesday, June 04, 2014] [09:30:28 AM] <jlschatz>	    this.$nub = createDiv("ticker-nub", this.$outer);
[Wednesday, June 04, 2014] [09:32:47 AM] <jlschatz>	muninn-project: here's the full. The lines I'm looking at are at line 73
[Wednesday, June 04, 2014] [09:32:50 AM] <jlschatz>	https://github.com/JaimeLynSchatz/stc/blob/master/ts_slider.js
[Wednesday, June 04, 2014] [09:33:35 AM] <muninn-project>	jlschatz: Is the timeslider function being called at all?
[Wednesday, June 04, 2014] [09:34:02 AM] <jlschatz>	muninn-project:  It is. I threw in some console.logs to check that.
[Wednesday, June 04, 2014] [09:34:39 AM] <jlschatz>	muninn-project: there's also ts_main.js: https://github.com/JaimeLynSchatz/stc/blob/master/ts_main.js
[Wednesday, June 04, 2014] [09:37:25 AM] <muninn-project>	Ok but is #slider-wrapper" getting triggered?
[Wednesday, June 04, 2014] [09:39:29 AM] <jlschatz>	muninn-project: I *think* so. To solve the previous error, I wrapped it in a document.ready and that's being called.
[Wednesday, June 04, 2014] [09:39:50 AM] <jlschatz>	muninn-project: let me dig a little more to make sure it is really being called.
[Wednesday, June 04, 2014] [09:42:35 AM] <muninn-project>	That is my knee-jerk reaction.
[Wednesday, June 04, 2014] [09:43:44 AM] <jlschatz>	muninn-project: Mine, too. Hence the hacky console logs :)

[Thursday, June 05, 2014] [09:27:41 AM] <jlschatz>	muninn-project: I had an idea to hard-code more of the slider (instead of having the divs generated in the slider.js file) but it seems to have made it worse. It was a wild idea I had late last night.

[Thursday, June 05, 2014] [10:23:37 AM] <jlschatz>	muninn-project: I'm missing something here. The ts_slider and ts_main files aren't showing up in the sources tabs in the dev tools when I load the page. The files are being run because my little console.logs are being triggered. Also, if I try to move the files around, Sprockets complains that it can't find the files.
[Thursday, June 05, 2014] [10:24:37 AM] <jlschatz>	muninn-project: Besides strategically-placed console.log files and looking at the sources and network tabs on the browsers, are there any other tricks for checking to see if a file has loaded? I seem to be getting conflicitng information.
[Thursday, June 05, 2014] [10:26:17 AM] <jlschatz>	I pushed my branch up to GitHub if you need to see the code. https://github.com/JaimeLynSchatz/ohm-website/tree/first_try

[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [08:23:44 AM] <SK53>	muninn-project: Hi, got back about 45 mins ago; any sign of chippy?
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [08:24:07 AM] <muninn-project>	No. He's not answering IM. David is travelling and unreachable.
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [08:24:15 AM] <muninn-project>	SK53: What's up?
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [08:25:11 AM] <SK53>	muninn-project: the thing in Nottingham in 2 weeks time. From your email are you going to be there?
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [08:25:54 AM] <muninn-project>	No. I'm stuck in NA for the time being. David probably will be.
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [08:26:59 AM] <SK53>	muninn-project: I've said yes to doing a talk to Katharina Lorenz, but have so far only given a general title of OHM: if you have some other ideas or suitable strap lines we can fill the rest in later
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [08:27:44 AM] <muninn-project>	Do you have a link to the title of the conference?
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [08:27:50 AM] <SK53>	muninn-project: I think chippy will be in Karlsruhe over the w/e, so I can talk to him then (he may already be travelling) & I think David is back tomorrow or the day after
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [08:28:09 AM] <SK53>	muninn-project: this one http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/ucn/workshops/urban-mapping.aspx
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [08:28:09 AM] <muninn-project>	yes
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [08:30:48 AM] <SK53>	muninn-project: loads of history on the hoof in Krakow: the parents of one of my hosts participated in the Warsaw uprising; there was a member of the WWII Resistance at the funeral; lots of Solidarnosc folk too
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [08:31:06 AM] <muninn-project>	Ok. looks inttersting. I can throw a few things off the top of my head - borrow some slides from the stom 2012 ?
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [08:31:59 AM] <SK53>	muninn-project: yes I think its really about spreading the word in circles of historians; I think the ontology-light aspect may be a bit stunning to some of them
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [08:32:35 AM] <SK53>	muninn-project: I'm just going to pop out to buy a few grocery essentials, brb (20 mins)
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [08:32:38 AM] <muninn-project>	OK. Do you want to borrow some of my 3D stuff?
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [08:51:25 AM] <jlschatz>	muninn-project: trying again here on irc
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [08:51:51 AM] <jlschatz>	muninn-project: it says awaiting acceptance by remote user
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [08:52:28 AM] <muninn-project>	Firewall in the way.
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [08:52:42 AM] <muninn-project>	Do you have a webserver where you can ut the tarball?
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [08:53:07 AM] <jlschatz>	muninn-project: Afraid not.
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [08:54:02 AM] DCC	Upload of "timeslider.tar.gz" to muninn-project failed. Reason: Timed out.
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [08:55:05 AM] <muninn-project>	got it
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [08:58:56 AM] <muninn-project>	sec
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [09:03:48 AM] <muninn-project>	I take it you're running your own install of rails?
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [09:05:20 AM] 	 * muninn-project curses rails.
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [09:05:46 AM] <muninn-project>	This might require some serious coffee.
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [09:05:49 AM] <jlschatz>	?? I thought I was running rails.
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [09:06:04 AM] <muninn-project>	You are running rails. 
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [09:06:06 AM] <muninn-project>	ok.
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [09:06:08 AM] 	 * muninn-project is not.
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [09:06:13 AM] <muninn-project>	Curse.s
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [09:06:14 AM] <jlschatz>	I'm running it through Vagrant.
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [09:06:19 AM] <muninn-project>	ok
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [09:06:32 AM] <jlschatz>	To try to avoid all the "my machine" "your machine" stuff.
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [09:06:42 AM] <muninn-project>	ok.
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [09:07:08 AM] <muninn-project>	When you are loading the page with the web console on, does it load all of the scripts and css it is supposed to?
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [09:07:53 AM] <jlschatz>	It's loading the scripts (I can see the console.logs  I threw in to test that and the css but...
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [09:08:19 AM] <jlschatz>	The divs that are generated don't come up either on the screen or in the F12 source.
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [09:08:30 AM] <jlschatz>	No error, just no divs.
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [09:09:40 AM] <muninn-project>	Ok.
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [09:09:51 AM] <muninn-project>	The divs are generated in rails or in javascript?
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [09:10:00 AM] <jlschatz>	In javascript
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [09:10:19 AM] <muninn-project>	Ok, pae source does not change when you insert things dynamically in javascript.
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [09:10:34 AM] <muninn-project>	make debuggigng painfule I know.
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [09:10:47 AM] <jlschatz>	It's in this file: https://github.com/JaimeLynSchatz/ohm-website/blob/time_slider2/app/assets/javascripts/ts_slider.js
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [09:10:51 AM] <jlschatz>	trying to find the line
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [09:11:25 AM] <muninn-project>	Do you have a console lo g print before and after you insert the div?
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [09:11:49 AM] <jlschatz>	I thought I did. Pulling it back up again.
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [09:12:03 AM] <muninn-project>	I'm not seeing anything here.
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [09:12:07 AM] <muninn-project>	logging wise.
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [09:13:48 AM] <jlschatz>	muninn-project: this is the log I'm seeing https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzUePM2aJYPjVXpUcWZwNGp6SFU/edit?usp=sharing
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [09:14:41 AM] 	 * muninn-project is seeing himself chat with jlschatz in the screenshoot. Spooky.
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [09:14:48 AM] <jlschatz>	muninn-project: lol
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [09:14:57 AM] <jlschatz>	muninn-project: I didn't crop. Sorry.
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [09:16:05 AM] <jlschatz>	muninn-project: there's an error there, it's a 500 server error from geocoder. I think it's unrelated.
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [09:20:14 AM] <muninn-project>	The function TimeSlider, is the the 'setup' function or is that the 'get the data' function?
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [09:20:27 AM] <muninn-project>	It seemsto be called several times if I read your thing properly/
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [09:20:29 AM] <muninn-project>	?
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [09:21:09 AM] <jlschatz>	muninn-project: 
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [09:21:30 AM] <jlschatz>	it's the setup. it's from the slider code fromt he Musictree download
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [09:21:52 AM] <muninn-project>	Am I reading your log correctly that it gets called multuple times?
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [09:21:56 AM] <jlschatz>	I'm not entirely sure why it's called so often - iwas expecitng it to be called three times
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [09:22:04 AM] <jlschatz>	There's a slider for the year, montha nd day
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [09:22:22 AM] <jlschatz>	muninn-project: I was expecting the slider to be called those three times.
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [09:22:54 AM] <jlschatz>	After they're called, there's a "reposition" method that positions the sliders, centered, under the three fields.
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [09:23:08 AM] <muninn-project>	ok
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [09:23:36 AM] <jlschatz>	muninn-project: this was the part that I tried ripping out and putting directly into the _search.html view
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [09:23:54 AM] <muninn-project>	If you go into 'web tools', 'inspector' - can you see thedivs in there?
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [09:24:16 AM] <jlschatz>	Only the divs that are coming from the views/layout code
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [09:24:21 AM] <jlschatz>	Not the javascript generated ones.
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [09:24:37 AM] <jlschatz>	I can see that the objects exist - that's what the console log is outputting.
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [09:24:44 AM] <jlschatz>	But they're not appearing.
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [09:25:53 AM] <muninn-project>	Ok. That's a problem.
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [09:26:12 AM] <jlschatz>	Yeah.
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [09:26:27 AM] <jlschatz>	The bloody-forhead banging against the computer kind. 
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [09:26:41 AM] <muninn-project>	javascirpt this...
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [09:26:58 AM] 	 * muninn-project blows a brain blood vessel trying to remember stuff.
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [09:27:05 AM] <jlschatz>	:)
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [09:28:48 AM] <muninn-project>	this.$outer  shoulld access the outer portion of the html.
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [09:30:53 AM] <jlschatz>	Yes. Is it trying to grab the <body> instead of the timeslider wrapper
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [09:30:59 AM] <jlschatz>	? Not sure how to check
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [09:31:56 AM] <jlschatz>	That would explain why it works when the slider is isolated in its own page.
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [09:34:22 AM] <muninn-project>	Ok. Question, why are you inserting the javascript dynamically?
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [09:34:35 AM] <jlschatz>	That's how it was done in the code from ..
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [09:34:41 AM] <jlschatz>	(forgot his name...)
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [09:35:28 AM] <muninn-project>	Not the way I'm reading the code from http://themusictree.net/ohm/
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [09:35:49 AM] <muninn-project>	the div's are allready in the html
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [09:35:53 AM] <jlschatz>	muninn-project: looking at it...
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [09:36:26 AM] <muninn-project>	main.js just binds code to the object model
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [09:37:08 AM] <jlschatz>	I was looking at this: view-source:http://themusictree.net/ohm/
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [09:37:31 AM] <muninn-project>	yup
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [09:37:47 AM] <muninn-project>	.ticker-nub-outer {
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [09:37:50 AM] <muninn-project>	allready in there.
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [09:38:10 AM] <jlschatz>	That part shows when I used "inspect element" but doesn't show at all when I do "view source"
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [09:38:26 AM] <muninn-project>	It's showing here... hum
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [09:38:47 AM] <jlschatz>	I could see the create element parts in the javascript and thought it meant that the javascript was generating those divs.
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [09:39:17 AM] <muninn-project>	I just checkedd with curl and the div's is allready there.
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [09:39:33 AM] <muninn-project>	where do you see the div creating? main.js or slider.js?
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [09:40:02 AM] <jlschatz>	slider.js
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [09:40:15 AM] <jlschatz>	here;s the view source for themusictree that I see:

[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [09:40:54 AM] <jlschatz>	I keep losing it. Hang on just a bit.
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [09:41:48 AM] <muninn-project>	Git it
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [09:42:01 AM] <muninn-project>	...ddo you have sometimes with "<div id="slider-wrapper">" in hte raw html?
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [09:42:32 AM] <jlschatz>	lines 75 - 78 in ts_slider.js

[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [09:46:45 AM] <muninn-project>	when you fire it up and you see the slider-wrapper div in page views?
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [09:48:44 AM] <jlschatz>	The slider-wrapper div is there with the three year, month and day data-step input boxes
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [09:48:44 AM] <muninn-project>	"can you see"
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [09:49:10 AM] 	 * muninn-project curses loudly and with style.

[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [09:51:31 AM] <muninn-project>	why are there two Class="query_wrapper" in there?
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [09:52:00 AM] <jlschatz>	good q
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [09:52:14 AM] 	 * muninn-project is suspiicous.
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [09:52:21 AM] <jlschatz>	I'm going to try putting them together.
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [09:52:23 AM] <muninn-project>	Class="query_wrapper", that's inserted by whom?
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [09:53:20 AM] <muninn-project>	It's at line 8 of searchh_html.erb onely once.
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [09:53:41 AM] <muninn-project>	I suspect you're getting a collision of class"<div class='query_wrapper'> and     <div id="slider-wrapper">
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [09:55:04 AM] <jlschatz>	I put them together. The site looks the same.

[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [09:59:38 AM] <muninn-project>	It looks good.
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [09:59:43 AM] <muninn-project>	This means the css is loading.
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [09:59:49 AM] <muninn-project>	It's not working .
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [09:59:54 AM] <muninn-project>	which means the js is the problem.
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [10:00:07 AM] <jlschatz>	Yeah.
[Tuesday, June 10, 2014] [10:02:08 AM] <muninn-project>	Oh christ, someone called Yet Another Meeting at 2:30.

[Thursday, June 12, 2014] [02:27:36 AM] <Chathurga>	There is a small bit of associated CSS, is that included too?
[Thursday, June 12, 2014] [04:26:03 AM] <Chathurga>	Hmm I see that it is, I'll clone the repo and take a look

[Thursday, June 12, 2014] [05:38:43 AM] <muninn-project>	Chathurga: She's on pacific time.
[Thursday, June 12, 2014] [05:39:42 AM] <jlschatz>	Chathurga: :/ i usually wake early, but not early enough for the rest of the world :)
[Thursday, June 12, 2014] [05:39:55 AM] <muninn-project>	She lives!
[Thursday, June 12, 2014] [05:40:15 AM] <Chathurga>	Haha
[Thursday, June 12, 2014] [05:40:28 AM] <jlschatz>	Chathurga: it's 5:40 here, what about for you?
[Thursday, June 12, 2014] [05:40:44 AM] <Chathurga>	leet o'clock, 13:37
[Thursday, June 12, 2014] [05:40:52 AM] <Chathurga>	well 38 now
[Thursday, June 12, 2014] [05:40:57 AM] <jlschatz>	tea time! :)
[Thursday, June 12, 2014] [05:41:08 AM] <Chathurga>	That is a damn early wake up time
[Thursday, June 12, 2014] [05:41:27 AM] <jlschatz>	I'm usually up earlier. My mom is visiting and came over last night. :)
[Thursday, June 12, 2014] [05:42:17 AM] <jlschatz>	So you're going to tell me I left off a semi-colon somewhere, I hope :)

[Thursday, June 12, 2014] [05:42:39 AM] 	 * jlschatz laughs
[Thursday, June 12, 2014] [05:44:43 AM] <Chathurga>	I'm going to have to pull down the repo, my hope is that in my isolated page where I made the slider there's something being positioned off <body> at (0, 0) and in the real page it's being positioned off something else
[Thursday, June 12, 2014] [05:45:35 AM] <jlschatz>	Chathurga: That makes sense.
[Thursday, June 12, 2014] [06:09:42 AM] <Chathurga>	jlschatz: There's 2 things with the ID slider-wrapper
[Thursday, June 12, 2014] [06:09:56 AM] <jlschatz>	Chathurga: I'm all ears
[Thursday, June 12, 2014] [06:09:59 AM] <Chathurga>	it's getting attached to the first one which is hidden
[Thursday, June 12, 2014] [06:10:28 AM] <Chathurga>	From looking at your commit though I don't see why there's 2, good ole rails
[Thursday, June 12, 2014] [06:11:54 AM] <jlschatz>	I'm not seeing that in the code., either.
[Thursday, June 12, 2014] [06:12:08 AM] <jlschatz>	Chathurga: weird...
[Thursday, June 12, 2014] [06:13:55 AM] <Chathurga>	Okay I see it, that search HTML is a fragment that is inserted in two places
[Thursday, June 12, 2014] [06:14:41 AM] <Chathurga>	jlschatz: Can I get commit access? I should be Chathurga (chathurga@gmail.com) on github
[Thursday, June 12, 2014] [06:15:45 AM] <jlschatz>	Chathurga: working on it
[Thursday, June 12, 2014] [06:18:33 AM] <jlschatz>	Chathurga: Done (I think. :)))
[Thursday, June 12, 2014] [06:52:15 AM] <Chathurga>	jlschatz: Okay pushed a commit, it should look vastly more sane now
[Thursday, June 12, 2014] [06:53:17 AM] <Chathurga>	Everything was also being run twice so I removed the JS file names from application.js
[Thursday, June 12, 2014] [06:53:29 AM] <Chathurga>	I dunno where else they're being pulled in from though
[Thursday, June 12, 2014] [06:56:23 AM] <jlschatz>	index.js
[Thursday, June 12, 2014] [06:56:51 AM] <Chathurga>	Ah yes I see it now
[Thursday, June 12, 2014] [07:01:10 AM] <jlschatz>	That looks much better :)!
[Thursday, June 12, 2014] [07:01:21 AM] <jlschatz>	(very slow load on my machine)
[Thursday, June 12, 2014] [07:05:34 AM] <jlschatz>	I'm pouring over your commits so I won't make this mistake again!
[Thursday, June 12, 2014] [07:11:13 AM] <Chathurga>	It was mostly that I had to change the slider code to handle $(...).timeControl when $(...) is more than one element
[Thursday, June 12, 2014] [07:15:57 AM] <jlschatz>	Chathurga: Thank you very much! This one's definitely going in the bug book!!
[Thursday, June 12, 2014] [07:16:46 AM] 	 * jlschatz goes to get the bug book :)

[Thursday, June 19, 2014] [08:13:04 AM] <jlschatz>	muninn_project: I'm going to find a new irc client. This one gives me so much trouble! :)
[Thursday, June 19, 2014] [08:16:04 AM] <muninn_project>	pimh
[Thursday, June 19, 2014] [08:16:07 AM] <muninn_project>	ok
[Thursday, June 19, 2014] [08:16:13 AM] <muninn_project>	How are things ogoing?
[Thursday, June 19, 2014] [08:16:15 AM] <jlschatz>	I'm currently fighting an intractable problem with heroku. I should have given up on it yesterday but I kept thiinking that I was just on the verge of solving it.
[Thursday, June 19, 2014] [08:16:31 AM] <muninn_project>	ok
[Thursday, June 19, 2014] [08:16:40 AM] <jlschatz>	I was trying to get a live version of my branch up and heroku doesn't like it.
[Thursday, June 19, 2014] [08:16:54 AM] <muninn_project>	would a real virtual machine help?
[Thursday, June 19, 2014] [08:17:13 AM] <jlschatz>	Oh! I'm using vagrant. I wonder if that's what's causing it.
[Thursday, June 19, 2014] [08:17:52 AM] <jlschatz>	All of the potential solutions I've come across don't say anything about vagrant. It's so smooth on my machine I forgot I was using it.
[Thursday, June 19, 2014] [08:18:05 AM] <jlschatz>	Major duh.
[Thursday, June 19, 2014] [08:18:30 AM] <muninn_project>	Ok. Keep going, if we get stuck we try something else
[Thursday, June 19, 2014] [08:18:38 AM] <muninn_project>	slider is working at the momen right?
[Thursday, June 19, 2014] [08:18:55 AM] <jlschatz>	It is - it's not doing anything with the input yet
[Thursday, June 19, 2014] [08:19:14 AM] <jlschatz>	I was working on that and then got seriously sidetracked with this.
[Thursday, June 19, 2014] [08:19:37 AM] <jlschatz>	There's a fallacy or something where you keep putting more money or effort into a failed venture because you feel like you've already put so much into it.
[Thursday, June 19, 2014] [08:19:45 AM] <jlschatz>	Whatever that's called, I had it big time with this.
[Thursday, June 19, 2014] [08:20:01 AM] <jlschatz>	I just wanted something to show for my efforts. :/
[Thursday, June 19, 2014] [08:20:20 AM] <muninn_project>	jlschatz: "Throwing good money after bad.
[Thursday, June 19, 2014] [08:20:46 AM] <jlschatz>	that summed it up nicely. :)
[Thursday, June 19, 2014] [08:21:54 AM] <jlschatz>	I'm checking github to make sure it's all up to date with where I am.
[Thursday, June 19, 2014] [08:22:11 AM] <jlschatz>	I've been making commits, making sure I actually pushed.
[Thursday, June 19, 2014] [08:22:19 AM] <jlschatz>	to my branch - not to master.
[Thursday, June 19, 2014] [08:22:33 AM] <muninn_project>	ok
[Thursday, June 19, 2014] [08:22:40 AM] <muninn_project>	We should get a box to try things with
[Thursday, June 19, 2014] [08:23:59 AM] <jlschatz>	Yes. I can hunt down how to do that - I know how to install an existing vagrnt box to my machine but never created my own.
[Thursday, June 19, 2014] [08:24:00 AM] <jlschatz>	yet
[Thursday, June 19, 2014] [08:25:54 AM] <muninn_project>	(dramatic music)
[Thursday, June 19, 2014] [08:25:57 AM] <muninn_project>	Ok.
[Thursday, June 19, 2014] [08:25:59 AM] <jlschatz>	:)
[Thursday, June 19, 2014] [08:26:04 AM] <muninn_project>	when you think you need it, we;ll get it.
[Thursday, June 19, 2014] [08:26:12 AM] <jlschatz>	ok.
[Thursday, June 19, 2014] [08:26:18 AM] <muninn_project>	Are you confy with how the selector works and are ready to look at time urls?
[Thursday, June 19, 2014] [08:26:39 AM] <jlschatz>	... i think so
[Thursday, June 19, 2014] [08:27:06 AM] <muninn_project>	Ok.
[Thursday, June 19, 2014] [08:27:26 AM] <muninn_project>	Right now the titling works by x/y/z
[Thursday, June 19, 2014] [08:27:37 AM] <jlschatz>	Yes.
[Thursday, June 19, 2014] [08:27:42 AM] <muninn_project>	where x/z are long,lat and z is zoom.
[Thursday, June 19, 2014] [08:27:49 AM] <muninn_project>	we need to add to that for time /date
[Thursday, June 19, 2014] [08:28:11 AM] <jlschatz>	Yes. We've got some stuff on that in the buzilla convo, right?
[Thursday, June 19, 2014] [08:28:16 AM] <muninn_project>	yup
[Thursday, June 19, 2014] [08:28:33 AM] <jlschatz>	I don't remember how we were going to form what comes after zoom
[Thursday, June 19, 2014] [08:28:37 AM] <jlschatz>	but i'll check
[Thursday, June 19, 2014] [08:28:59 AM] <muninn_project>	I'm tempeted to tell you to only worry about year for now
[Thursday, June 19, 2014] [08:30:00 AM] <jlschatz>	lol. What about focusing on the times for the Burning Man maps?
[Thursday, June 19, 2014] [08:30:20 AM] <jlschatz>	*for* now, not *from* now. Sorry, read too fast
[Thursday, June 19, 2014] [08:30:22 AM] <jlschatz>	nvm!!!
[Thursday, June 19, 2014] [08:30:31 AM] <muninn_project>	np
[Thursday, June 19, 2014] [08:30:39 AM] <muninn_project>	but yes, its a good test case.
[Thursday, June 19, 2014] [08:30:45 AM] <muninn_project>	and easy to code for.
[Thursday, June 19, 2014] [08:30:56 AM] <muninn_project>	no messy calendaring.
[Thursday, June 19, 2014] [08:31:03 AM] <jlschatz>	Yes!
[Thursday, June 19, 2014] [08:35:06 AM] <jlschatz>	found the bug in bugzilla. Does t for time still ok?
[Thursday, June 19, 2014] [08:36:50 AM] <jlschatz>	We could then either go with the Star Trek-y decimal approach or add further pieces t/m/d, depending on consensus. If i'm remembering the TimsStampz db properly, I think we could make either work.
[Thursday, June 19, 2014] [08:38:41 AM] <muninn_project>	t is still fine
[Thursday, June 19, 2014] [08:38:50 AM] <muninn_project>	but you can defined whatever you want.
[Thursday, June 19, 2014] [08:38:55 AM] <muninn_project>	including more than one space.
[Thursday, June 19, 2014] [08:38:56 AM] <muninn_project>	er
[Thursday, June 19, 2014] [08:38:58 AM] <muninn_project>	spec
[Thursday, June 19, 2014] [08:39:05 AM] <jlschatz>	ok
[Thursday, June 19, 2014] [08:39:13 AM] <muninn_project>	fromYear/ToYear ?
[Thursday, June 19, 2014] [08:40:23 AM] <jlschatz>	I think that might get us into some of the territory we were talking about in that hangout a while back, where there are objects that aren't the same throughout the given time frame.
[Thursday, June 19, 2014] [08:40:29 AM] <jlschatz>	Did we ever resolve that?
[Thursday, June 19, 2014] [08:40:33 AM] <muninn_project>	no
[Thursday, June 19, 2014] [08:40:40 AM] <muninn_project>	not your problem through.
[Thursday, June 19, 2014] [08:40:46 AM] <jlschatz>	Ok, cool.
[Thursday, June 19, 2014] [08:41:04 AM] <muninn_project>	You're "Just Rendering What's There"
[Thursday, June 19, 2014] [08:41:09 AM] <jlschatz>	You got it :)
[Thursday, June 19, 2014] [08:41:28 AM] <jlschatz>	I've got plenty of problems. I won't borrow :)
[Thursday, June 19, 2014] [08:44:52 AM] <muninn_project>	exxxcelent
[Thursday, June 19, 2014] [08:48:00 AM] <jlschatz>	Ok, so my next steps are to create a year piece to the url and feed the year input box/year slider from the slider. The current slider doesn't ask for a range, just a start. Is that ok for a beginning?
[Thursday, June 19, 2014] [08:49:07 AM] <muninn_project>	Yes.
[Thursday, June 19, 2014] [08:49:17 AM] <muninn_project>	Easy to mod once you're comfy with it.
[Thursday, June 19, 2014] [08:49:28 AM] <muninn_project>	Just mod the url request
[Thursday, June 19, 2014] [08:49:31 AM] <muninn_project>	get comfy with it 
[Thursday, June 19, 2014] [08:49:37 AM] <jlschatz>	Ok I will.
[Thursday, June 19, 2014] [08:49:37 AM] <muninn_project>	and they we move to .... RENDERING!
[Thursday, June 19, 2014] [08:49:51 AM] <jlschatz>	(dramatic music) :D
[Thursday, June 19, 2014] [08:56:03 AM] <jlschatz>	Before I go too far into digging in the code...
[Thursday, June 19, 2014] [08:56:22 AM] <jlschatz>	Thank you! I was getting way to caught up in unproductive yak shaving.
[Thursday, June 19, 2014] [08:56:36 AM] <jlschatz>	Perspective is good!!

[Friday, June 20, 2014] [10:28:06 AM] <jlschatz>	is that the corridor track I hear about?
[Friday, June 20, 2014] [10:28:29 AM] <jlschatz>	or "Hallway Track"
[Friday, June 20, 2014] [10:29:31 AM] <muninn-project>	Hell way track sounds better.
[Friday, June 20, 2014] [10:29:50 AM] <jlschatz>	No, that's at PAX.

I might be away by the time you see this, but after some failures, I've been focusing on this: https://github.com/JaimeLynSchatz/ohm-website/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/router.js, getting my head around the OSM.router. It's very different from anything I've seen before. If I'm waaay off, ping me and I'll pivot.

[Saturday, June 21, 2014] [05:10:19 AM] <muninn-project>	Ok.

[Saturday, June 21, 2014] [05:12:07 AM] <jlschatz>	Ok :) Thanks I know it's early, but I knew I wouldn't be able to be on here at a more reasonable time but wanted to catch you if you were around when I was not. :)

[Thursday, July 03, 2014] [01:24:53 PM] <muninn-project>	jlschatz: https://wiki.gnome.org/OutreachProgramForWomen/Admin/InternshipTime
[Thursday, July 03, 2014] [01:35:23 PM] <jlschatz>	muninn-project: I'm reading. What am I looking for?
[Thursday, July 03, 2014] [01:35:55 PM] <muninn-project>	jlschatz: 500$ for treavel to event relevant to the project.
[Thursday, July 03, 2014] [01:36:42 PM] <jlschatz>	muninn-project: I've been looking for conferences that might work for that. So much of the conferences and events for Wiki are reaaalllly far - too far that $500 would make them doable.
[Thursday, July 03, 2014] [01:37:45 PM] <jlschatz>	muninn-project: Do you have any ideas for conferences that are applicable? I'm looking into attending a Ruby conf in Oregon (and applied for assistance to attend one in Madison, WI). I was going to ask you if they might be appropriate to the internship b/c so much of the OHM is in Ruby/Rails.
[Thursday, July 03, 2014] [01:38:41 PM] <jlschatz>	muninn-project: not sure if I meant appropriate to the internship. Applicable? Related enough? Very bummed that I couldn't get to OSBridge in Portland earlier this month. I just couldn't get all mu ducks (kids) in a row quickly enough.
[Thursday, July 03, 2014] [01:40:50 PM] <muninn-project>	hum
[Thursday, July 03, 2014] [01:40:55 PM] <muninn-project>	what about a mapping conference?
[Thursday, July 03, 2014] [01:41:05 PM] <muninn-project>	The 'relevance' is something we can bend.
[Thursday, July 03, 2014] [01:41:15 PM] <muninn-project>	What do you think woudl be useful.
[Thursday, July 03, 2014] [01:42:29 PM] <jlschatz>	muninn-project: There's http://stateofthemap.us/ for 2015 it's in the spring. 
[Thursday, July 03, 2014] [01:42:41 PM] <jlschatz>	muninn-project: I might actually know enough to be useful by then :D
[Thursday, July 03, 2014] [01:43:46 PM] <muninn-project>	ha!
[Thursday, July 03, 2014] [01:43:51 PM] <muninn-project>	Keep an eye out.
[Thursday, July 03, 2014] [01:43:54 PM] <muninn-project>	We still have time.
[Thursday, July 03, 2014] [01:44:15 PM] <muninn-project>	jlschatz: Going to head home before my sweetheart sends the marines for me.

[Friday, July 04, 2014] [11:39:30 AM] <muninn-project>	You mean flooding and hurricaine aren't valid reasons not to check email?

[Monday, July 07, 2014] [06:42:10 AM] <jlschatz>	Good morning/afternoon/evening, everyone :)
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [06:42:12 AM] <jlschatz>	muninn-project, if you get some time this week, I've got some issues and notes in the GitHub repo: https://github.com/OpenHistoricalMap/ohm-website/pull/18 and https://github.com/OpenHistoricalMap/ohm-website/issues/19
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [06:43:16 AM] <SK53>	jlschatz: seen your issue 19, probably just needs to get deleted from the DB (it's just a set of primary highways)
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [06:43:59 AM] <jlschatz>	SK53: I was thinking that the OHM, Baby' part
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [06:44:25 AM] <SK53>	jlschatz: exactly
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [06:44:26 AM] <jlschatz>	was, idk - graffiti?
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [06:44:53 AM] <jlschatz>	SK53: Did someone tag it for deletion? It kind of caught me by surprise. :)
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [06:45:38 AM] <SK53>	jlschatz: actual done by Jeff Meyer (as I suspected), but will now delete http://www.openhistoricalmap.org/way/198099821
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [06:47:41 AM] <jlschatz>	SK53: Ah, I think I see how you found that. (I'm still finding my way here, no pun intended.) Many thanks! :)
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [06:49:10 AM] <SK53>	jlschatz: I've commented the issue (I noticed it last week when I wanted to grab a screen image of Seattle), but not familiar enough with github to know how to close the issue :-)
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [06:49:52 AM] <jlschatz>	SK53: all closed :) Thanks again :D
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [06:49:55 AM] <SK53>	jlschatz: glad to see that you can close it
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [06:50:38 AM] <muninn-project>	jlschatz: roger. busy now. back in a few.
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [06:50:53 AM] <jlschatz>	muninn-project: No worries :)
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [06:51:03 AM] <SK53>	jlschatz: if afraid I dont really have the knowledge to say anything useful on the pull request
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [06:53:01 AM] <jlschatz>	SK53: :) Thank you for looking at it anyway. I'll sync up with mun. and get things going :D
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [06:53:04 AM] <chippy>	jlschatz, generally I'd recommend compressing the commits into one
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [06:53:40 AM] <jlschatz>	chippy: Is that something that can be done after the fact? (very green :D)
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [06:54:08 AM] <chippy>	it should be done before it's merged
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [06:54:22 AM] <chippy>	Now, the second thing is: what does it actually do?
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [06:54:46 AM] <chippy>	"Users can select a start year " is the only comment
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [06:55:13 AM] <jlschatz>	chippy: Right now, it acknowledges the year being requested. I don't know yet how to bring up year-specific tiles. (I've been trying to bring up the Burning Man tiles based on the year without any luck so far.)
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [06:55:27 AM] <chippy>	so the thing I would recommend is some additonal comments with screenshot or description saying what it does
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [06:55:47 AM] <jlschatz>	chippy: and i think I just found some instructions for how to fix the fifty-thousand commits in to one :)
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [06:55:50 AM] <chippy>	in general then, would adding this feature lead to something that does not work?
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [06:56:05 AM] <chippy>	rebase I think may do the job
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [06:56:36 AM] <chippy>	you might want to keep your commits in one branch, and rebase/squash them together in another if you want to keep your historu
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [06:56:40 AM] <chippy>	history
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [06:57:25 AM] <jlschatz>	chippy: i would like to keep the history, if for no other reason than to see where I've tried something odd and it failed. I'll work on that.
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [06:57:45 AM] 	 * muninn-project complains, grumbles.
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [06:58:36 AM] <jlschatz>	chippy: as far as functionality, this is kind of at a half-way (third way?) point. This is the first time I've worked on a fork of a project that I expect to merge back into the master. I've been very fearful about straying too far from master and having a huge conflicted mess.
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [06:59:01 AM] <jlschatz>	muninn-project: :( yoga + inordinate amounts of coffee can help any day :D lol
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [07:00:04 AM] <chippy>	jlschatz, yes, you should keep the history, although for a "whole feature"  and particularly for a Pull Request, if think (and I could search for it) the Best Practices recommend them to be all in one commit
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [07:00:23 AM] <SK53>	chippy: does github provide for release points as the basis for merges rather than individual commits
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [07:00:34 AM] <chippy>	jlschatz, don't worry about straying far from master and conflicts :-)
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [07:00:48 AM] <jlschatz>	chippy: got it. I will dig in to that and get it right :)
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [07:01:16 AM] <chippy>	think of the pull request not as "this issue is complete" but rather "this feature is ready for production"
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [07:01:18 AM] <jlschatz>	whoops, ^^ above meant for SK53 and chippy 
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [07:01:49 AM] <jlschatz>	chippy: ok. Will do. Thank you :)
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [07:02:08 AM] <chippy>	jlschatz, I think what this really is about is for someone else to check out your code to look at it themselves working
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [07:02:43 AM] <jlschatz>	chippy: would it be ok/better to put requests like that as an issue?
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [07:02:57 AM] <chippy>	dont worry about pull requests
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [07:03:16 AM] 	 * SK53 has been asking people *exactly* what a pull request is, so is learning lots here
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [07:03:53 AM] <chippy>	if you want to track the whole feature as a single issue, please do create a single issue for it. Like "this is the parent task/issue, here are the subtasks/issues underneath"
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [07:03:57 AM] 	 * muninn-project pours everyone a shot of espresso.
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [07:04:04 AM] <chippy>	thanks muninn-project 
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [07:04:31 AM] <chippy>	a pull request is a request for the maintainer to pull in some other code
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [07:04:57 AM] <chippy>	so there's 2 ways that I or someone else can see the 1/2 way work so far I think
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [07:05:14 AM] <chippy>	1) people setting up local instances and using it locally
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [07:05:49 AM] <muninn-project>	Can we find a box to put an instance to test the whole stack?
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [07:05:49 AM] <chippy>	2) a development instance to be shown on a server (or home computer etc) somewhere 
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [07:06:37 AM] <Nelg>	SK53: this is lengthy, but comprehensive https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [07:06:53 AM] <Nelg>	but i have to admit that i still don't understand the Git parlance completely
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [07:07:05 AM] <Nelg>	or how it works
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [07:07:10 AM] <Nelg>	iana developer
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [07:07:49 AM] <SK53>	Nelg: I've been using the question as a sort of test of how good people are at explaining things: especially as I first used SCCS 30 years ago & have experience of Continuus (or whatever its called these days) in big-iron shops
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [07:08:29 AM] <SK53>	Nelg: that's quite clear for github :-)
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [07:08:32 AM] <chippy>	it's a github thing really - it's a wrapper around git merges et
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [07:08:39 AM] <Nelg>	i have never heard of those things, as i wasn't even alive 30 years ago :P
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [07:09:03 AM] 	 * jlschatz gives Nelg a thumbs up
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [07:09:17 AM] <Nelg>	chippy: if you have time at some point, could you walk me through how to point JOSM to upload into the OHM API?
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [07:09:26 AM] <Nelg>	then i could make some documentation for the wiki
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [07:09:30 AM] <Nelg>	jlschatz: thx
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [07:09:31 AM] <jlschatz>	Nelg: I was, but certainly wasn't coding yet
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [07:09:41 AM] <chippy>	Nelg, have you consulted the JOSM documentation / OSM wiki on configurations?
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [07:10:01 AM] <SK53>	Nelg: SCCS original source management system on UNIX http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_Code_Control_System ; Continuus is now Rational Synergy, config & release management used in commercial (IBM) sites http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuus
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [07:10:10 AM] <chippy>	if so, have a look in the JOSM preferences, one of the tabs has the necessary box to change
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [07:10:21 AM] <chippy>	the actual URL would differ
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [07:11:12 AM] <Nelg>	ah, now i find it, after i ask
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [07:11:14 AM] 	 * SK53 knows about these things in general, but usually has not had to use them himself: usually been members of his team
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [07:11:17 AM] <Nelg>	api.openhistoricalmap.com/api?
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [07:11:22 AM] <Nelg>	*org
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [07:11:38 AM] <SK53>	Nelg: no, think its www.openhistoricalmap.org/api
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [07:11:43 AM] <chippy>	try it and see :)
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [07:11:51 AM] <muninn-project>	www.openhistoricalmap.org/api
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [07:12:07 AM] <Nelg>	so http?

[Monday, July 07, 2014] [07:12:37 AM] <muninn-project>	we aren't. yet.
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [07:12:37 AM] <chippy>	yes http

[Monday, July 07, 2014] [07:13:35 AM] <jlschatz>	Maybe I need to rtm on how to internet.
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [07:14:38 AM] <chippy>	It is http://www.openhistoricalmap.org/api/0.6/
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [07:15:16 AM] <chippy>	and the link isnt meant to be clicked, it's meant to be used by an editor application :)
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [07:15:21 AM] <Nelg>	but should it respond to http get requests?
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [07:15:24 AM] <Nelg>	that
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [07:15:42 AM] <Nelg>	now i need to recall how to make different JOSM profiles..
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [07:16:11 AM] <chippy>	http://www.openhistoricalmap.org/api/0.6/map?bbox=26.72424316406251,58.37867853932656,26.72973632812501,58.381558503186966  
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [07:16:21 AM] <chippy>	click that with a mouse and get an .osm file ^
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [07:17:28 AM] 	 * jlschatz sighs/smiles at how far the end of the tunnel seems :/
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [07:17:34 AM] <chippy>	I guess it might not need the /0.6/ bit in JOSM?
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [07:18:38 AM] <chippy>	yeah without the /0.6/ in JOSM  - there's even a "validate" box to help
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [07:19:05 AM] <chippy>	jlschatz, it looks like you are doing lots of progress! 
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [07:19:19 AM] <jlschatz>	chippy: thank you :)
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [07:19:49 AM] <chippy>	in lieu of one of us getting their own instance running and if you require feedback on how it looks / works , screenshots help :)
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [07:21:10 AM] <jlschatz>	chippy: :) I will make extensive use of screenshots. :) 
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [07:21:32 AM] <chippy>	one can copy and paste images directly into github comment boxes now - makes it very easy I find ... well if I don't use my extra large screen as then the image is too large :(
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [07:22:02 AM] <chippy>	it's either very large monitor or tiny netbook screen
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [07:29:44 AM] <Nelg>	does OAuth work?
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [07:30:07 AM] <chippy>	Nelg, which direction?
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [07:30:08 AM] <Nelg>	if i make a request to validate, it responds with an error
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [07:30:27 AM] <Nelg>	when i click Authorise Now at JOSM
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [07:30:41 AM] <chippy>	and "validate" box
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [07:30:44 AM] <chippy>	did that work?
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [07:31:15 AM] <Nelg>	yes, that gives a green checkmark
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [07:32:17 AM] <chippy>	Nelg, tab for advanced properties what urls are given?
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [07:32:43 AM] <Nelg>	those are still openstreetmap's
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [07:33:00 AM] <Nelg>	i should just replace the 'street' with 'historical'?
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [07:33:02 AM] <chippy>	voila :)
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [07:33:13 AM] <chippy>	you could just use basic auth if you want it quick
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [07:33:26 AM] <chippy>	I've not tried oauth with josm
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [07:33:31 AM] <chippy>	but it is enabled
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [07:35:18 AM] <Nelg>	yeah, it requires some Consumer Key and Consumer Secret, which i have no idea about
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [07:35:24 AM] <Nelg>	basic it is
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [07:36:17 AM] <chippy>	yeah I think JOSM has to be set up as a client application by yourself 
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [07:37:12 AM] <chippy>	or by an admin, but then the default settings and a custom JOSM file would need to be created and .... maintend
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [07:37:54 AM] <chippy>	Nelg, feel free to add Issues to github with these sticking points as Im sure others will encounter them after you
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [07:38:23 AM] <Nelg>	..goddammit. i was editing my import-JOSM
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [07:38:25 AM] <Nelg>	starting again
[Monday, July 07, 2014] [07:56:55 AM] <Nelg>	ok, now. now i'll make that tutorial

[Tuesday, July 08, 2014] [06:24:07 AM] <chippy>	jlschatz, morning. I have slider2 working locally
[Tuesday, July 08, 2014] [06:30:06 AM] <chippy>	what do you see as being in the results?
[Tuesday, July 08, 2014] [07:55:29 AM] <jlschatz>	chippy: sorry - head down in the code and didn't see your message. :(
[Tuesday, July 08, 2014] [07:55:30 AM] <jlschatz>	chippy: 
[Tuesday, July 08, 2014] [07:56:00 AM] <jlschatz>	chippy: right now, it's supposed to capture the search year. I've been trying to figure out how to link that to a map
[Tuesday, July 08, 2014] [07:57:30 AM] <jlschatz>	chippy: my first attempts were to pull from the wikimedia api for that year page but I wasn't getting any where - it was supposed to be a quick fix that was taking much longer than i anticipated. I'm currently stuck on trying to bring up the Burning Man maps by their urls. not completely stuck, but not there yet.
[Tuesday, July 08, 2014] [08:04:01 AM] <jlschatz>	chippy: I thought I had a github issue with a screenshot showing the year query but nto finding it immediately. Still looking.
[Tuesday, July 08, 2014] [08:05:21 AM] <jlschatz>	chippy: there we go. Image: https://camo.githubusercontent.com/dcad6c0bb0aca80fe25541d1553c8c67e5e4eb2f/687474703a2f2f6a61696d656c796e73636861747a2e6769746875622e696f2f73746172745f796561725f71756572792e706e67, issue: https://github.com/OpenHistoricalMap/OpenHistoricalMap/issues/4
[Tuesday, July 08, 2014] [08:10:31 AM] <chippy>	jlschatz, i quite like the controls  - how they work
[Tuesday, July 08, 2014] [08:11:20 AM] <jlschatz>	chippy: yeay :) Conor did the design.
[Tuesday, July 08, 2014] [08:11:23 AM] <chippy>	jlschatz, do you think that the search results would work like present day nominatum? that is, showing up places in the OHM?
[Tuesday, July 08, 2014] [08:11:38 AM] <chippy>	in other words should it be a control to a temporal gazetteer?
[Tuesday, July 08, 2014] [08:11:39 AM] <jlschatz>	chippy: That's what I was trying to make happen
[Tuesday, July 08, 2014] [08:11:56 AM] <jlschatz>	chippy: I thought it would make sense for there to be the same look across location and time search.
[Tuesday, July 08, 2014] [08:12:16 AM] <chippy>	does make sense - and would be a good starting point
[Tuesday, July 08, 2014] [08:12:35 AM] <chippy>	have you looked at nominatum?
[Tuesday, July 08, 2014] [08:12:43 AM] <chippy>	or is that out of scope?
[Tuesday, July 08, 2014] [08:12:48 AM] <jlschatz>	chippy: I think I'm going to get it. It's taking a long time (much longer than I anticipated.) 
[Tuesday, July 08, 2014] [08:13:07 AM] <jlschatz>	chippy: looking at Nominatum would give me some clues as to how it all works, i think
[Tuesday, July 08, 2014] [08:13:57 AM] <jlschatz>	chippy: I was poking around in the paret where the api is caled (not sure if terminology is right) and that's what made me think I should use the wikmedia or wikidata api to pull up things related to the year being search.
[Tuesday, July 08, 2014] [08:14:20 AM] <jlschatz>	chippy:  based on the last meeting/call, it sounded like the maps would be stored in wikidata ??? (may have misunderstood)
[Tuesday, July 08, 2014] [08:14:43 AM] <chippy>	no idea either :)
[Tuesday, July 08, 2014] [08:15:09 AM] <chippy>	yeah the OSM search finds things via geonames and via openstreetmap / nominatum
[Tuesday, July 08, 2014] [08:15:25 AM] <jlschatz>	chippy: I started down a very long rabbit hole with the api and so i put that on hold and tried to just specifically bring up the maps that are already there in the layers.
[Tuesday, July 08, 2014] [08:15:34 AM] <chippy>	so we should be able to hook into  wikidata into it 
[Tuesday, July 08, 2014] [08:15:45 AM] <chippy>	yes, rabbit holes are a hallmark of OHM! :)
[Tuesday, July 08, 2014] [08:15:58 AM] <jlschatz>	:)
[Tuesday, July 08, 2014] [08:16:10 AM] <chippy>	I think that the selection of the maps via time is a key thing also
[Tuesday, July 08, 2014] [08:16:46 AM] <jlschatz>	Yes! 
[Tuesday, July 08, 2014] [08:16:56 AM] <chippy>	along with the dynamic creation etc
[Tuesday, July 08, 2014] [08:18:38 AM] <jlschatz>	Yes - to make it work like location/zip/etc. :) Do you think I should keep working on trying a first-case of getting it to pull up one of the Burning Man maps?
[Tuesday, July 08, 2014] [08:19:17 AM] <chippy>	could be a quick win
[Tuesday, July 08, 2014] [08:20:36 AM] <jlschatz>	chippy: I'm fighting waves of panic over how little progress I've made. I know it's cliche, but I really underestimated how long all of this would take me.
[Tuesday, July 08, 2014] [08:21:06 AM] <chippy>	jlschatz, "task completion wishful thinking syndrome"
[Tuesday, July 08, 2014] [08:21:22 AM] <jlschatz>	chippy: precisely :)
[Tuesday, July 08, 2014] [08:21:35 AM] <chippy>	dont worry though - all things are overestimated - everyone understands it really.
[Tuesday, July 08, 2014] [08:22:07 AM] <chippy>	there are whole industries in IT devoted to making better estimates
[Tuesday, July 08, 2014] [08:22:35 AM] <chippy>	im currently suffering in my own projects with the same issue
[Tuesday, July 08, 2014] [08:22:48 AM] <jlschatz>	chippy: what are you working on ?
[Tuesday, July 08, 2014] [08:23:18 AM] <chippy>	this is updating five year old warper code to latest rails stack 
[Tuesday, July 08, 2014] [08:23:54 AM] <jlschatz>	that certainly does sound like fun :)
[Tuesday, July 08, 2014] [08:23:58 AM] <chippy>	I do a bit then I hit a wall and have to back track. For example the mapserver library doesn't work with Ruby 2.0 just 1.9

[Thursday, July 10, 2014] [09:25:03 AM] <jlschatz>	muninn-project: I have one (at least I think that's what I have ;) ). I'm using a Vagrant box - sometime in April-ish, the installation docs added instructions for how to install the OHM using Vagrant.
[Thursday, July 10, 2014] [09:25:43 AM] <muninn-project>	ok
[Thursday, July 10, 2014] [09:26:56 AM] <jlschatz>	muninn-project: something I'm been bashing against from time to time is figuring out which bit of code is doing what in the site. I'm getting better, but not an expert on it yet :/

[Thursday, July 10, 2014] [09:27:37 AM] <muninn-project>	But I'm confidence that peice of js is it.
[Thursday, July 10, 2014] [09:28:07 AM] <muninn-project>	suggest you try and get it to work with a local variable to get the url working, and then work backwards

[Tuesday, July 15, 2014] [12:58:29 PM] <muninn-project>	That was a miseable meeting.
[Tuesday, July 15, 2014] [12:58:30 PM] <muninn-project>	Ok.
[Tuesday, July 15, 2014] [12:58:48 PM] <muninn-project>	jlschatz: The renderd code that handles the burnin man layer is what you want.
[Tuesday, July 15, 2014] [12:58:53 PM] <muninn-project>	It's keying on a date.
[Tuesday, July 15, 2014] [12:59:30 PM] <jlschatz>	I will look again - the piece I'm finding is keying on a layer name
[Tuesday, July 15, 2014] [01:00:07 PM] <muninn-project>	Look at how it queryies the db and insert a turl name in there.
[Tuesday, July 15, 2014] [01:00:23 PM] <jlschatz>	muninn-project: in here https://github.com/OpenHistoricalMap/ohm-website/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/leaflet.map.js.erb

[Tuesday, July 15, 2014] [01:00:40 PM] <muninn-project>	the layer is just a url style, 
[Tuesday, July 15, 2014] [01:00:54 PM] <muninn-project>	You now have to look at the rendering on the server.
[Tuesday, July 15, 2014] [01:11:27 PM] <jlschatz>	I'm sorry, I'm really lost. Is this where I should be looking? https://github.com/OpenHistoricalMap/ohm-website/blob/master/vendor/assets/leaflet/leaflet.osm.js

[Tuesday, July 15, 2014] [01:13:18 PM] <muninn-project>	You want to add one yes.
[Tuesday, July 15, 2014] [01:13:26 PM] <muninn-project>	But you want one layer that is time aware.

[Tuesday, July 15, 2014] [01:16:06 PM] <jlschatz>	this is where we add the {t} to the {s}.tile.domain.org/{z}/{x}/{y}/{t}.png ?? The {t} can reference whatever time object we're using like in the TZ database (or am I missing something big here?)
[Tuesday, July 15, 2014] [01:18:24 PM] <muninn-project>	no that's it.
[Tuesday, July 15, 2014] [01:19:33 PM] <muninn-project>	you hijack a new url http://www.openhistoricalmap.org/ohm_vary/{t}/{z}/{x}/{y}.png'
[Tuesday, July 15, 2014] [01:19:38 PM] <muninn-project>	insert it in there.
[Tuesday, July 15, 2014] [01:20:03 PM] <muninn-project>	Then hacj away at the code that handles the ohm_2008 as an example of the mods for renders
[Tuesday, July 15, 2014] [01:20:50 PM] <jlschatz>	Ok. So for the 'vary' portion of the url - do we have one we're using yet or are we making that up right now?
[Tuesday, July 15, 2014] [01:20:54 PM] <jlschatz>	ok
[Tuesday, July 15, 2014] [01:21:55 PM] <muninn-project>	we're making it up at this very moment.
[Tuesday, July 15, 2014] [01:22:06 PM] <jlschatz>	Ok.
[Tuesday, July 15, 2014] [01:22:14 PM] <muninn-project>	I suggest year for an initial test.
[Tuesday, July 15, 2014] [01:22:22 PM] <jlschatz>	I will use that.
[Tuesday, July 15, 2014] [01:22:23 PM] <muninn-project>	you can compare againts 2008/2009 after.
[Tuesday, July 15, 2014] [01:23:00 PM] <muninn-project>	ok. AFK for an hour. sweetheart demanding presence.

[Monday, July 28, 2014] [07:29:33 AM] <muninn-project>	jlschatz: Did you catch the above with chippy?
[Monday, July 28, 2014] [07:30:08 AM] <jlschatz>	yes, Im bouncing between irc tabs - there's also a opw intern meeting going on in #opw
[Monday, July 28, 2014] [07:30:25 AM] <muninn-project>	roger
[Monday, July 28, 2014] [07:31:07 AM] <jlschatz>	muninn-project: it looks like it's wrapping up soon. I've got the link to the wiki, did i miss another link (and soooo glad I don't need to get the python renderer working - majob head bashing last night on that)
[Monday, July 28, 2014] [07:31:19 AM] <muninn-project>	No python no.
[Monday, July 28, 2014] [07:32:44 AM] <jlschatz>	I like python but some of the libraries R requires do not like my computer
[Monday, July 28, 2014] [07:33:31 AM] <muninn-project>	I feel the pain, through you can expet some with the renderd setup, 
[Monday, July 28, 2014] [07:33:38 AM] <muninn-project>	we will over come.
[Monday, July 28, 2014] [07:39:59 AM] <muninn-project>	(dramatic music)
[Monday, July 28, 2014] [07:40:01 AM] <jlschatz>	i can deal with some :) (I managed to install Pythong, Ruby, Rails. etc on a windows machine before. I can deal with square pegs and round holes :D)
[Monday, July 28, 2014] [07:41:35 AM] <jlschatz>	oh! and I may have just discovered what one of my issues was with the r-alphahull package last night. I'll put it on the queue. (
[Monday, July 28, 2014] [07:42:35 AM] <chippy>	jlschatz, are you coming to wikimania btw?
[Monday, July 28, 2014] [07:43:02 AM] <jlschatz>	chippy: no, I can't make it across the pond, as it were. :)
[Monday, July 28, 2014] [07:44:24 AM] <jlschatz>	I am going to a 10th Year Anniversary meetup for OSM. Organized by Clifford Snow
[Monday, July 28, 2014] [07:44:27 AM] <chippy>	okay :)
[Monday, July 28, 2014] [07:44:36 AM] <chippy>	ooh, enjoy! I hope to go to the one in London
[Monday, July 28, 2014] [07:44:48 AM] <chippy>	I went to the 2nd
[Monday, July 28, 2014] [07:46:19 AM] <jlschatz>	chippy: It sounds so awesome. I'll make it out there eventually :D. I'm also potentially going to FOSS4G. (Trying to get all my ducks in order)

[Monday, July 28, 2014] [01:09:33 PM] <jlschatz>	Hi all :). I've been fumbling around with the commands on http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OHM/Dev and (finally) got node working properly (had to change the registry to .eu, the CDN at .org is apparently down) I'm poking around in the code of https://github.com/OpenHistoricalMap/ohm_mod_tile/, but I don't *really* know what I'm looking for. I can feel the new synapses forming but I don't know if I'm going down a productive path.
[Monday, July 28, 2014] [01:14:58 PM] <jlschatz>	Funny aside: I was searching for carto references in the ohm repo and found lots of SPANISH! (map === *carto*graphia)

[Monday, July 28, 2014] [01:23:15 PM] <muninn-project>	jlschatz_wikimedia_intern: Ok. You're searching for the bit of code that gets the data from the database before rending.
[Monday, July 28, 2014] [01:24:31 PM] <jlschatz_wikimedia_intern>	Am I looking in the right place: ohm_mod_tile? Trying to follow along with the info on the wiki but not sure if I'm going down a rabbit hole
[Monday, July 28, 2014] [04:24:16 PM] <muninn-project>	jlschatz_wikimedia_intern: documentation fro renderd sucjs
[Monday, July 28, 2014] [04:24:36 PM] <jlschatz_wikimedia_intern>	muninn-project: yes, yes it does :)
[Monday, July 28, 2014] [04:26:11 PM] <jlschatz_wikimedia_intern>	I'm tracing my way through ohm_mod_tile - I found the bash (?) script that builds up the url (the renderer uses a different url with "combinations" of the x and y coordinates) and so it has to go back and forth between the two formats.
[Monday, July 28, 2014] [04:27:52 PM] <jlschatz_wikimedia_intern>	I'm tracing through daemon.c which seems to be running most of the show, but, again, still tracing through.
[Monday, July 28, 2014] [04:28:15 PM] <muninn-project>	jlschatz_wikimedia_intern: trying to track down the db connection.
[Monday, July 28, 2014] [04:28:21 PM] <muninn-project>	jlschatz_wikimedia_intern: shitth documenttion
[Monday, July 28, 2014] [04:29:08 PM] <jlschatz_wikimedia_intern>	If the Sorcerer's book was easy to understand, Mickey wouldn't have gotten into so much trouble with those brooms. Docs sometimes seem to be intentionally cryptic :D.
[Monday, July 28, 2014] [04:33:44 PM] <muninn-project>	humm
[Monday, July 28, 2014] [04:35:35 PM] <jlschatz_wikimedia_intern>	There's a function in there called send_response that sends an object called item (which I think is the map requested with x and y coordinates) along with a render_time limit
[Monday, July 28, 2014] [04:39:38 PM] <muninn-project>	 urses
[Monday, July 28, 2014] [04:41:25 PM] <jlschatz_wikimedia_intern>	send_response uses send(), which (don't know if it's the same one) is defined in renderd.py (the comments in that file say it's a port of the renderd.c, but the c version isn't in this repo)
[Monday, July 28, 2014] [04:42:01 PM] <muninn-project>	damm them where is code ;)
[Monday, July 28, 2014] [04:43:51 PM] <jlschatz_wikimedia_intern>	???
[Monday, July 28, 2014] [04:45:12 PM] <muninn-project>	Damm
[Monday, July 28, 2014] [04:45:21 PM] <muninn-project>	I'm cursing how the code is written,
[Monday, July 28, 2014] [04:46:24 PM] <jlschatz_wikimedia_intern>	So I take it that this is not a model of well-structured code?
[Monday, July 28, 2014] [04:47:04 PM] <jlschatz_wikimedia_intern>	It's like a map written in another language that you can only read by moonlight every 12 years.
[Monday, July 28, 2014] [04:47:44 PM] <muninn-project>	jlschatz_wikimedia_intern: You're trying to cheer me up, aren't you?

[Monday, July 28, 2014] [04:51:48 PM] <jlschatz_wikimedia_intern>	this is that page that I was trying to follow along with until I got to the point when it asked if I wanted to override the db.
[Monday, July 28, 2014] [04:52:28 PM] <jlschatz_wikimedia_intern>	I remember doing some of this (?? I think) many many moons ago (wow, like in the spring) when first setting up. I don't this I did all of this, though.
[Monday, July 28, 2014] [04:52:52 PM] <jlschatz_wikimedia_intern>	where do you even enter a password? When setting up the db users?
[Monday, July 28, 2014] [04:55:28 PM] <muninn-project>	that is in the

[Monday, July 28, 2014] [04:58:18 PM] <muninn-project>	jlschatz_wikimedia_intern:  this going to require a little bit of hacking.
[Monday, July 28, 2014] [04:58:39 PM] <jlschatz_wikimedia_intern>	muninn-project: It certainly looks like it
[Monday, July 28, 2014] [04:59:27 PM] <muninn-project>	Take a look at line 223?
[Monday, July 28, 2014] [04:59:32 PM] <jlschatz_wikimedia_intern>	the bit that talks about changing the extent parameters for custom projections answers a question I had.
[Monday, July 28, 2014] [04:59:34 PM] <jlschatz_wikimedia_intern>	looking...
[Monday, July 28, 2014] [05:00:58 PM] <muninn-project>	We need to get the url parameters in there 
[Monday, July 28, 2014] [05:01:09 PM] <jlschatz_wikimedia_intern>	<< "SELECT ST_SRID(\"" << geometryColumn_ << "\") AS srid FROM "

[Monday, July 28, 2014] [05:01:33 PM] <jlschatz_wikimedia_intern>	I don't know if I'm looking in the right spot?
[Monday, July 28, 2014] [05:02:10 PM] <jlschatz_wikimedia_intern>	is our url the geometry_field?
[Monday, July 28, 2014] [05:07:27 PM] <jlschatz_wikimedia_intern>	is srid_ the rendered tiles? Trying to follow along here.
[Monday, July 28, 2014] [05:08:01 PM] <jlschatz_wikimedia_intern>	oh, it's map jargon. Reading up.
[Monday, July 28, 2014] [05:10:36 PM] <muninn-project>	humm
[Monday, July 28, 2014] [05:10:50 PM] <muninn-project>	srid is the projection type
[Monday, July 28, 2014] [05:12:09 PM] <jlschatz_wikimedia_intern>	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRID ?
[Monday, July 28, 2014] [05:12:30 PM] <jlschatz_wikimedia_intern>	should I get this out of my head?
[Monday, July 28, 2014] [05:13:11 PM] <muninn-project>	its set for us so we dont have to worry about it
[Monday, July 28, 2014] [05:13:25 PM] <jlschatz_wikimedia_intern>	Ok.
[Monday, July 28, 2014] [05:24:28 PM] <muninn-project>	This code is pretty hard core
[Monday, July 28, 2014] [05:26:15 PM] <jlschatz_wikimedia_intern>	I'm having trouble telling what language it is - it looks like a mashup of C++ and SQL? (I know not strictly a programming language, but...)
[Monday, July 28, 2014] [05:26:28 PM] <muninn-project>	jlschatz_wikimedia_intern: Need to get that config file from the ohm box.
[Monday, July 28, 2014] [05:26:41 PM] <muninn-project>	jlschatz_wikimedia_intern: It's C++ with a SQL inline
[Monday, July 28, 2014] [05:27:01 PM] <jlschatz_wikimedia_intern>	ok, so I can tell what language it is :) (tiny win)
[Monday, July 28, 2014] [05:27:28 PM] <jlschatz_wikimedia_intern>	? the config file from *which* ohm box? (there are so many repos called ohm_something)
[Monday, July 28, 2014] [05:28:13 PM] <muninn-project>	http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OHM/Dev
[Monday, July 28, 2014] [05:28:28 PM] <muninn-project>	mapnik_2008.xml on the ohm
[Monday, July 28, 2014] [05:28:58 PM] <muninn-project>	I suspect there's a config parameters to lock in the year config.
[Monday, July 28, 2014] [05:29:27 PM] <muninn-project>	If we can get that it will be a hint of where in the code to find the magic to add to the query.
[Monday, July 28, 2014] [05:30:21 PM] <muninn-project>	eseentialy, we need to make the year = xxx in the WHERE clause, but I'd rather re-use as much of the code as possible.
[Monday, July 28, 2014] [05:30:41 PM] <muninn-project>	Do you mind if we shut it down for tonight and I'll login to the machine tomorrow first thing?
[Monday, July 28, 2014] [05:31:19 PM] <jlschatz_wikimedia_intern>	No problem. :/ Sorry to keep you up with this. 
[Monday, July 28, 2014] [05:31:32 PM] <muninn-project>	It's my job. ;)
[Monday, July 28, 2014] [05:31:40 PM] <jlschatz_wikimedia_intern>	:D  Well, thank you.

[Tuesday, July 29, 2014] [10:21:20 AM] <muninn-project>	Bad router. Bad.
[Tuesday, July 29, 2014] [10:22:12 AM] <jlschatz>	 I was reading through the code last night. It looks like daemon.c received an object called (?) req with all the goods in it. I haven;t found where it's receiving it yet.
[Tuesday, July 29, 2014] [10:25:01 AM] <muninn-project>	It sohuld be through a pipe file.
[Tuesday, July 29, 2014] [10:25:16 AM] <jlschatz>	ok
[Tuesday, July 29, 2014] [10:25:26 AM] <muninn-project>	apache gets the url, passes to mod-tile who pushes it to the pipe which renderd reads.

[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [07:39:05 AM] <jlschatz>	I think/hope a little sleep might be making this clearer. (Clearer than the mud I was looking through last night, at least :) ) 
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [07:39:29 AM] <jlschatz>	I'm looking at the code here: https://github.com/OpenHistoricalMap/ohm_mod_tile/blob/master/renderd.py, near line 124, for example
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [07:39:53 AM] <jlschatz>	Is the ProtocolPacket being passed around the map described by the mapnik styles?
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [07:41:11 AM] <jlschatz>	If so, then we can add a self.t = t there after adding the t parameter in the styles? (Getting fuzzy again. :eyeroll: at myself)
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [07:41:57 AM] <jlschatz>	(And by there, I mean by everywhere there are refs to self.x, self.y and self.z)

[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [07:51:40 AM] <muninn-project>	Looking at it now.
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [07:52:29 AM] <muninn-project>	We likely need ot change the packet version to something else to prevent insanity later on.

[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [07:54:09 AM] <muninn-project>	What its doing is moving everything into a packed binary structures.

[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [07:56:46 AM] <muninn-project>	talks about the way to describe a format
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [07:58:08 AM] <muninn-project>	how long should a year be? -3500 to 2014? 5 byte string including the -
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [07:59:18 AM] <jlschatz>	ok. (we can avoid continental drift)
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [08:06:57 AM] <jlschatz>	oops, brb
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [08:07:00 AM] Away	You are now marked as being away (reason: Gone away for now).
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [08:10:57 AM] <muninn-project>	jlschatz: Let's try for a string now since that can support eras also.
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [08:28:56 AM] Away	You are no longer marked as being away.
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [08:30:14 AM] <jlschatz>	The doc talks about padding strings to make up for different lengths - we can use that, right? (Imagining trying to create a list of eras with a specific phrase length and shuddering)
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [08:31:58 AM] <muninn-project>	Right.
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [08:32:16 AM] <muninn-project>	Let's pad it to 5 bytes for now?
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [08:43:01 AM] <jlschatz>	Making sure I'm understanding - we change the format string to "5i4l5s" ?
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [08:45:57 AM] <muninn-project>	No. you have to add to it.
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [08:46:10 AM] <muninn-project>	5i = 5 integers.
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [08:46:28 AM] <muninn-project>	41s = 1st string 41 char long
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [08:46:31 AM] 	 * jlschatz nodding but not fully understanding

[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [08:47:14 AM] <muninn-project>	20+41+3=64
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [08:48:02 AM] <jlschatz>	Oh - I thought that was an L
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [08:48:16 AM] <jlschatz>	(couldn't figure out why we'd need and int and a long)
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [08:48:25 AM] <jlschatz>	that makes a lot more sense.
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [08:48:46 AM] <muninn-project>	normally, we'd need to align things so that byte alignment makes sense if the struct gets moved from one machine to another.
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [08:49:30 AM] <muninn-project>	see 7.3.2.1. Byte Order, Size, and Alignment
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [08:49:42 AM] <jlschatz>	THat makes sense. I was reading the format string wrong - saw the 1 as an L
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [08:49:47 AM] <jlschatz>	reading there again
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [08:51:07 AM] <muninn-project>	I don't remeber the alightments anymore, but I suspect we can ingore it for a prototype.
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [08:51:41 AM] <muninn-project>	self.fields = "5i41s5s" should work as an experiemnt.

[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [08:52:36 AM] <muninn-project>	i?
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [08:52:40 AM] <jlschatz>	oops
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [08:53:36 AM] <jlschatz>	Trying to formulate my question. Failing.
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [08:53:52 AM] <muninn-project>	1st syllable, 1st word?
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [08:54:07 AM] <jlschatz>	:)
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [08:54:20 AM] <jlschatz>	I'm confused about the version numbers on the ProtocolPackets
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [08:54:51 AM] <jlschatz>	At first I was thinking we would create a new version - but I only see V1 and V2 and not sure what they're there for, so I"m thinking no
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [08:55:08 AM] <muninn-project>	You should add V3.
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [08:55:15 AM] <jlschatz>	ok
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [08:55:26 AM] <muninn-project>	the version number is there to indicate to the code what type of struct it should expect
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [08:55:51 AM] <muninn-project>	so if the mod_tile sends V1, V2 or V3, renderd knows how to parse the structures.
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [08:56:07 AM] <jlschatz>	Ok, that's what I thought but then I wasn't sure why there were only 2 versions.
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [08:56:20 AM] <jlschatz>	Or why there are two versions and not just one - 
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [08:56:28 AM] <jlschatz>	I've got more reading to do, don't I? :)
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [08:58:23 AM] <muninn-project>	you have two peices of sofware talking over a binary connection: mod_tile and renderd
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [08:58:42 AM] <muninn-project>	mod_tile tells renderd "I'm sending you a binary structure, V1"
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [08:58:58 AM] <muninn-project>	rednerd reads the binary structure and parses it with the V1 code.
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [08:59:00 AM] 	 * jlschatz nodding, getting it
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [08:59:17 AM] <muninn-project>	THe V's make sure that both software packages are talking the same language.
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [08:59:44 AM] <muninn-project>	Now you're going to add V3, to make sure that you're answering a query with the 't' parameter instead of the other two.
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [08:59:52 AM] <muninn-project>	DAMM YOU NETSPLIT!
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [08:59:57 AM] <jlschatz>	Ok. What are the existing two versions? Are the two 2008 and 2009 maps the same version
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [09:00:07 AM] <muninn-project>	nonon.
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [09:00:13 AM] <muninn-project>	Versions of the binary protocol.
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [09:00:25 AM] <muninn-project>	Two peices of software, two maintiners.
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [09:00:39 AM] <muninn-project>	The V makes sure both software packages are talking the same protocol.
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [09:01:46 AM] <muninn-project>	V1 has self.fields = "5i"
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [09:01:56 AM] <muninn-project>	V2 has self.fields = "5i41sxxx"
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [09:02:08 AM] <muninn-project>	The V's jsut makes sure the tright structure is being parsed.
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [09:02:09 AM] <jlschatz>	Was this to make sure the new version wouldn't break systems that used the old?
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [09:02:16 AM] <muninn-project>	exactly.
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [09:02:21 AM] <jlschatz>	Ok got it.
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [09:02:38 AM] <muninn-project>	so if someone wrote new ways of doing things, like you, outdates software would complain instead of crashing.
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [09:02:57 AM] 	 * jlschatz finally getting it
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [09:03:09 AM] <muninn-project>	Ok.
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [09:03:22 AM] <muninn-project>	So you're adding v3 to account for your changes to renderd.
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [09:03:31 AM] <muninn-project>	and you'll add v3 to modtile later
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [09:03:35 AM] <jlschatz>	Yes.
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [09:06:19 AM] <muninn-project>	Welcome back SK53
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [09:06:45 AM] 	 * jlschatz waves Hi!
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [09:10:26 AM] <muninn-project>	jlschatz: AFK 10 mins.
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [09:36:53 AM] <muninn-project>	Back
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [10:43:40 AM] <jlschatz>	(at the risk of sounding like the parents in HISH's Frozen) So I've got V3 added and included self.t in the packing/unpacking in renderd.py. I've been searching through mod_tile.c (after re-reading the readme, which makes a lot more sense now) and 
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [10:44:57 AM] <jlschatz>	think I've found where the protocol is being passed in: `static int request_tile(request_rec *r, struct protocol *cmd, int renderImmediately)`, about line 187 in https://github.com/OpenHistoricalMap/ohm_mod_tile/blob/master/mod_tile.c
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [10:45:49 AM] <muninn-project>	Ok.
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [10:45:52 AM] <jlschatz>	Still going through. I took an into to C class when my now-driving son was still in diapers so I'm going slowly 
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [10:46:12 AM] <jlschatz>	(but remembering how much I loved C)
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [10:46:34 AM] 	 * jlschatz is being serious, no snark. jlschatz loves the language
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [10:47:31 AM] <muninn-project>	It's great if you want complete control over what the machine is doing
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [10:47:50 AM] <muninn-project>	 cmd->ver = PROTO_VER;
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [10:47:55 AM] <muninn-project>	line 205
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [10:48:03 AM] <jlschatz>	Yes - where is PROTO_VER set?
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [10:48:10 AM] <jlschatz>	That's the only reference to it in this file
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [10:48:22 AM] <jlschatz>	(unless Sublime Text is lying to me. Dirty computer)
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [10:49:38 AM] <jlschatz>	git grep to the rescue. checking stuff out (not literally)
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [10:50:06 AM] <muninn-project>	I'm looking for it. I expected it in mod_tile.h but it's not there either.
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [10:50:32 AM] <jlschatz>	protocol.h
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [10:51:13 AM] <jlschatz>	Am I reading that right - it's hardcoded to 2?  `#define PROTO_VER (2)`
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [10:51:22 AM] <muninn-project>	Yup.
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [10:51:39 AM] <muninn-project>	Now, you're going to hard code it to 3 ;)
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [10:51:44 AM] <jlschatz>	can we do an if something or other in that file to set it to 3 if we have a t?
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [10:51:47 AM] <jlschatz>	oops, typed over you
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [10:53:08 AM] <muninn-project>	You're better off making it 3 and having renderd ignoring a blank 't'.
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [10:53:35 AM] <jlschatz>	Cool :)
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [11:04:05 AM] <jlschatz>	I'm looking at places that reference the params and wonder if we should/can put in some logic so we don't go asking mod_tile to look at the variable t if it isn't there (or do we just default to current year or is this a conversation for another day?)
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [11:04:56 AM] <muninn-project>	Keep in mind that mod_tile generated this from the url
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [11:05:04 AM] <muninn-project>	/t/x/y/z.png
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [11:05:12 AM] <muninn-project>	having a blank t would be 
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [11:05:16 AM] <muninn-project>	//t/z/y/z
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [11:05:24 AM] <muninn-project>	which in may os's actually means
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [11:05:41 AM] <muninn-project>	//x/y/z -> /x/y/z
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [11:05:48 AM] <muninn-project>	and then the parsing becomes ambiguous.
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [11:06:11 AM] <muninn-project>	best to use the standad mod-tile for a normal layer and your mod tile for a time layer.
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [11:06:25 AM] <muninn-project>	because you are handling box V2 and V3 in renderd
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [11:06:38 AM] <muninn-project>	you can have both rendered by the same code.
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [11:06:44 AM] <muninn-project>	but you still need two mod_tiles.
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [11:07:00 AM] <jlschatz>	ok.
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [11:11:10 AM] <jlschatz>	afk for 5
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [11:11:14 AM] <muninn-project>	ok

[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [11:48:55 AM] <jlschatz>	No, I fixed the evil.
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [11:49:15 AM] <jlschatz>	I was trying to understand a part of the code that's using x, y and z and trying to decide if/how to add t
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [11:49:42 AM] <jlschatz>	I'm at a variable called `oob`, couldn't figure it out right away so I searched
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [11:49:56 AM] <jlschatz>	Not helpful. Then it hit me, out of bounds
[Wednesday, July 30, 2014] [11:50:08 AM] <jlschatz>	duh on me, but finally got it

[Friday, August 01, 2014] [08:11:16 AM] <jlschatz>	That is seriously gross. I still think Starbucks is behind it. Once we figure out how to talk to the orcas, Starbucks will be selling them lattes to feed their caffeine addictions!
[Friday, August 01, 2014] [08:17:28 AM] <muninn-project>	Either that or the killer orcas will start eating humans for their high caffeine content.

[Monday, August 04, 2014] [04:55:45 AM] <muninn-project>	SK53: But winter is when the fun things happen. 
[Monday, August 04, 2014] [04:56:06 AM] <jlschatz>	LOL. True. I was thinking about that while trying to set up coverage for a study group I help cohost
[Monday, August 04, 2014] [04:56:42 AM] <jlschatz>	It's tough finding people - there's just so much going on (and Seattle traffic in the summer is AWFUL-er than usual)
[Monday, August 04, 2014] [04:58:30 AM] <jlschatz>	It's just called "Civic Holiday?"
[Monday, August 04, 2014] [04:59:34 AM] <muninn-project>	It's the local holiday for the province being formed. 
[Monday, August 04, 2014] [04:59:38 AM] <muninn-project>	Raining of course.

[Monday, August 04, 2014] [05:22:58 AM] <jlschatz>	muninn-project: I'm unsure of what my next steps are. I've been re-reading it, trying to get my head around it more.
[Monday, August 04, 2014] [05:23:03 AM] <jlschatz>	I've got the new version 3 added
[Monday, August 04, 2014] [05:23:20 AM] <jlschatz>	but not fully sure I've got it right.
[Monday, August 04, 2014] [05:23:40 AM] <jlschatz>	I've got the changes I made in the link on my wiki page. Let me bring it up again.
[Monday, August 04, 2014] [05:24:28 AM] <muninn-project>	Ok.

[Monday, August 04, 2014] [05:27:58 AM] <muninn-project>	Does the order of the pack fit "self.fields = "5i41sxxx5s""
[Monday, August 04, 2014] [05:27:59 AM] <muninn-project>	?
[Monday, August 04, 2014] [05:28:59 AM] <jlschatz>	smh! I have no idea. Looking, I don't think so. Fixing.
[Monday, August 04, 2014] [05:30:37 AM] <muninn-project>	Ok, that is something to worry about because the parsoing will follow the field order you give it
[Monday, August 04, 2014] [05:33:12 AM] <jlschatz>	Yes. Can we make t come to follow the rest of the code? (it's that way in the url, it's alphabetical and kind of logical - determines what map to look at)
[Monday, August 04, 2014] [05:33:57 AM] <jlschatz>	Would that look like 5i5s4lsxxx" ? finding that reference again, because now I'm not sure.
[Monday, August 04, 2014] [05:34:34 AM] <jlschatz>	That first sentence is unintelligible. packed as t, x, y, z
[Monday, August 04, 2014] [05:35:34 AM] <muninn-project>	hum
[Monday, August 04, 2014] [05:36:43 AM] <jlschatz>	About to be packed, that should say, if you think we should go that way
[Monday, August 04, 2014] [05:36:46 AM] <muninn-project>	5i is 5 interfer
[Monday, August 04, 2014] [05:36:55 AM] <muninn-project>	integers.
[Monday, August 04, 2014] [05:37:23 AM] <muninn-project>	bout version, request, t, x, y, z, xmlname = struct.unpack(self.fields, data)
[Monday, August 04, 2014] [05:37:36 AM] <muninn-project>	version and requests are integers?
[Monday, August 04, 2014] [05:37:58 AM] <jlschatz>	That's what I thought. I didn't change that part.
[Monday, August 04, 2014] [05:38:15 AM] <jlschatz>	I messed up and stuck the t in the front of x,y,z
[Monday, August 04, 2014] [05:38:28 AM] <jlschatz>	but added the 5s at the end of the unpack config
[Monday, August 04, 2014] [05:40:30 AM] <muninn-project>	isn't 5s a string?
[Monday, August 04, 2014] [05:40:41 AM] <muninn-project>	5i41sxxx5s
[Monday, August 04, 2014] [05:41:00 AM] <muninn-project>	https://docs.python.org/2/library/struct.html
[Monday, August 04, 2014] [05:41:36 AM] <muninn-project>	5 int's 41chars 3 pad bytes 5 chars
[Monday, August 04, 2014] [05:42:45 AM] <jlschatz>	I keep seeing that as 4L. Argh. (LEARN!!)
[Monday, August 04, 2014] [05:42:47 AM] <muninn-project>	If it unpacks left to right
[Monday, August 04, 2014] [05:43:08 AM] <muninn-project>	z is going to be hanging into the string.
[Monday, August 04, 2014] [05:43:16 AM] <jlschatz>	We went through this, sorry. We want 5i46sxxx5s
[Monday, August 04, 2014] [05:43:47 AM] <jlschatz>	without the 5s
[Monday, August 04, 2014] [05:43:52 AM] <muninn-project>	5i41s5sxxx
[Monday, August 04, 2014] [05:44:00 AM] <jlschatz>	Oh.
[Monday, August 04, 2014] [05:44:05 AM] <muninn-project>	The 41s is xmlname and 5s is t
[Monday, August 04, 2014] [05:44:20 AM] <muninn-project>	.unpack uses the different markers to split the strings.
[Monday, August 04, 2014] [05:44:33 AM] <muninn-project>	5i46sxxx5s would put all 46bytes into the same string
[Monday, August 04, 2014] [05:45:21 AM] <jlschatz>	I thought that x y z and xmlname were in the 41s.
[Monday, August 04, 2014] [05:45:33 AM] <jlschatz>	So where are the x y z unpacked in Version 2?
[Monday, August 04, 2014] [05:46:49 AM] <muninn-project>	Sorryy do you have a url for that?
[Monday, August 04, 2014] [05:47:43 AM] <jlschatz>	just a sec, bringing up again
[Monday, August 04, 2014] [05:48:50 AM] <jlschatz>	https://github.com/openstreetmap/mod_tile/blob/master/renderd.py
[Monday, August 04, 2014] [05:49:03 AM] <jlschatz>	line 124
[Monday, August 04, 2014] [05:49:52 AM] <muninn-project>	version, request, x, y, z are all passed as integers.
[Monday, August 04, 2014] [05:49:59 AM] <muninn-project>	xmlname is the string
[Monday, August 04, 2014] [05:50:17 AM] <muninn-project>	talk a look at line 91
[Monday, August 04, 2014] [05:50:52 AM] <jlschatz>	right, version 1 is just 5i.
[Monday, August 04, 2014] [05:51:16 AM] 	 * jlschatz smacks head again :?
[Monday, August 04, 2014] [05:51:49 AM] <muninn-project>	meh.
[Monday, August 04, 2014] [05:51:55 AM] <muninn-project>	left to right,
[Monday, August 04, 2014] [05:52:07 AM] <muninn-project>	parses whatever the field list is and dumps it into the vriables
[Monday, August 04, 2014] [05:53:14 AM] <jlschatz>	so is it better to keep continuity here and put 5s and t at the end or to follow the other parts of the code and keep t first in the list of t, x, y, z params and have the unpacking directions as 2i5s3i41sxxx ?
[Monday, August 04, 2014] [05:56:00 AM] <muninn-project>	I'd keep the 5s after the 41s since it won't crash the parser if its wrong.
[Monday, August 04, 2014] [05:56:37 AM] <jlschatz>	Ok.
[Monday, August 04, 2014] [05:57:58 AM] <jlschatz>	After the 41s and before the xxx padding?
[Monday, August 04, 2014] [05:58:09 AM] <jlschatz>	(making sure I get it this time)
[Monday, August 04, 2014] [05:59:00 AM] <muninn-project>	ye.s
[Monday, August 04, 2014] [05:59:06 AM] <muninn-project>	passid is
[Monday, August 04, 2014] [05:59:26 AM] <jlschatz>	Ok. :) (was so afraid you'd say "no" and that meant that I was intractably confused.)
[Monday, August 04, 2014] [05:59:30 AM] <muninn-project>	the padding was to make it 64 chars long
[Monday, August 04, 2014] [06:00:03 AM] <muninn-project>	let's pad it to ...128?
[Monday, August 04, 2014] [06:00:47 AM] <muninn-project>	chippy: Padding is for edianess or alignment issues. o you think 128 bytes is going to far?
[Monday, August 04, 2014] [06:01:00 AM] <muninn-project>	jlschatz: let's pad it to 128 bytes for now.
[Monday, August 04, 2014] [06:01:09 AM] <jlschatz>	Ok... there's a better way than adding 59 x's, right? (lookng at the python doc again)
[Monday, August 04, 2014] [06:03:44 AM] <muninn-project>	59x should do it.
[Monday, August 04, 2014] [06:09:25 AM] <jlschatz>	ok, so we're at 5i41s5s62x = vers, request, x, y, z, xmlname, t, 62 padding (original 3 padding plus 59 more to bring it up to 128) ?
[Monday, August 04, 2014] [06:10:31 AM] <muninn-project>	looks good to me.
[Monday, August 04, 2014] [06:11:56 AM] <jlschatz>	Ok. (relief for both of us, I think)
[Monday, August 04, 2014] [06:20:43 AM] <jlschatz>	Ok. updated and pushed up diff log, renderd.py changes start at about 189

[Monday, August 04, 2014] [06:22:16 AM] <muninn-project>	ok it looks good
[Monday, August 04, 2014] [06:22:26 AM] <muninn-project>	are you going to install a test setup?
[Monday, August 04, 2014] [06:23:17 AM] <jlschatz>	Yes. Still figuring out all the dependencies.
[Monday, August 04, 2014] [06:23:35 AM] <jlschatz>	I blew some stuff up the last time I tried but going again. :)
[Monday, August 04, 2014] [06:25:03 AM] <muninn-project>	we'll try to get peices working  before trying to whole taks
[Monday, August 04, 2014] [06:25:25 AM] <jlschatz>	Yes :)
[Monday, August 04, 2014] [06:25:38 AM] <jlschatz>	I thought it would be fairly straightforward the first few times around
[Monday, August 04, 2014] [06:25:39 AM] <jlschatz>	Ha
[Monday, August 04, 2014] [06:26:09 AM] <muninn-project>	you never know what evil lurks in code
[Monday, August 04, 2014] [06:26:33 AM] <jlschatz>	:) That's a good warning
[Monday, August 04, 2014] [06:27:01 AM] <jlschatz>	That's why they're called daemons!
[Monday, August 04, 2014] [06:33:22 AM] <chippy>	you should see the german mod tile project
[Monday, August 04, 2014] [06:33:26 AM] <chippy>	they pass in stuff
[Monday, August 04, 2014] [06:33:55 AM] <muninn-project>	chippy: opignions about packet length?
[Monday, August 04, 2014] [06:34:33 AM] <chippy>	no idea
[Monday, August 04, 2014] [06:38:14 AM] <chippy>	jlschatz, have you seen this: http://gis.19327.n5.nabble.com/parameterization-of-mapnik-style-sheets-in-mod-tile-renderd-and-multi-lingual-maps-td5781510.html
[Monday, August 04, 2014] [06:38:48 AM] <jlschatz>	reading now
[Monday, August 04, 2014] [06:40:21 AM] <chippy>	i cant find the actual code, but they changed mod_tile to pass in languages ("de") in the url
[Monday, August 04, 2014] [06:40:39 AM] <chippy>	but the discussion and the links from that might help if you are passing in similar parameters
[Monday, August 04, 2014] [06:41:44 AM] <chippy>	http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Multilingual_maps_Wikipedia_project/Final_Report
[Monday, August 04, 2014] [06:42:22 AM] <jlschatz>	Thank you for passing these on
[Monday, August 04, 2014] [06:42:47 AM] <chippy>	it could be at the mapnik level 
[Monday, August 04, 2014] [06:43:00 AM] <chippy>	it could be at the renderd or mod_tile - or all three to work :-)
[Monday, August 04, 2014] [06:43:24 AM] <chippy>	i've not dived into the code, but it was pointed out to me when asking the people on #osm-dev how to do temporal rendering
