The overall OHM project page: http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/
Open_Historical_Map The goal of the project was, essentially, to put a time slider on a fork of the Open Street Map to enable users to search for historical maps that have been loaded into the system.

An example of how we used the issue tracker on GitHub:
https://github.com/OpenHistoricalMap/ohm-website/issues/15

The codebase is quite complex. It is actually three separate codebases, written in several languages: Javascript, Ruby, C, C++ and Python (with a healthy serving of Bash scripts for interpreting map paths!) I was able to integrate a minimum viable slider into the website, have it feed the year portion of the query through and up to the server. I've also modified the renderer to accept time as a parameter. A big stumbling block (besides not knowing C/C++ and spending some internship time studying the language !!) has been the difficulty in keeping the renderer backwards-compatible with non-time queries, but I'm still working on it! 

There's still so much more to do. Three months was simply not enough time for me to complete the entire project. I plan to keep contributing.

The project can use more contributors! The team lead Susannaanas (https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Grants:IdeaLab/Build/Make_an_editing_interface_for_the_Map_template) has started a page in the Idea Labs for one piece of the project: https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Grants:IdeaLab/Build/Make_an_editing_interface_for_the_Map_template
