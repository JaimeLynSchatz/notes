	#Software Estimation

Why is Agile so scary?

1-2 days per story granularity

"No plan survives contact with the enemy."

Eisenhower's quote: "Plans are rubbish (or whatever) but planning is indespensible"

"The map is not the terrain"
How to get from LA to SF.

Control & Accountability
1. Get an estimate
2. Fail to deliver?
3. Blame the estimator!

"I need an estimate, but I'm not going to hold you to it!"
You get to lie once ... at this job.

Shift from Control to Risk Management
Intstead of blowing up horribly every two years, break it down into two weeks.

Planning Poker - breaks up the status quo
Cons: Confuses effort and ambiguity
No way of tracking why someone doesn't know


Scrum Anti-Pattern
-Joint Planning Session
-Make commit for delivery for next two weeks
-External teams don't deliver
-Drag everyone in
-Or start padding the estimations

Scrum Planning Death Spiral
Standups are just status reportss
Mini waterfalls
Never meet sprint goals
scrum sucks!!

Kanban boards - include external dependenies out of a column so you cna see where its blocked.

Planning Board (if you have the analysis board in place, you can make informed decisions here)
Takes in Epics
New Feature Ideas - separate out the good ideas and the requests for a faster horse
Outputs scoped Stories 
So who's on that planning team? It should be the folks who are going to produce the work on that board

Execution Board
Takes in Scoped Stories
OUTputs Working Software
Extermanl depencenies are tracked via a column

Analysis Board
A/B Test Results
Overall Analysis
Look at the outputs of the execution board

Roadmap Planning
- Who does the Roadmap planning
- What ar the skills needed?
  - data to make good decisions
  - estimation skills
  - elicitaiton skills
- What level of detail? (Powerpoint, not Excel)

- Product Owner + Product Manager
Connects loop between planning and anlystics
Management Q: Do implemented features move the needle?

- Execution Lead (solutions manager, dev lead, tech lead, whatever it's called for that group)
 Managers flow, optimizes lean flow
Management @: what is the cycle time for 1-2day stories from planning into prod?


Product Road Map
- 2-4 week level golden features
- Pits on PowerPoint

Split Board Kandab Board
- Evolve Scrum from basics
- Planning, Implementation, Analystics

How do you handle planning for features and needs that are due way out (like planning for E3 or Partner Conference)
Pick one feature that can be the main story to build the marketing campaign.
(Apple's thing with "faster" What is the smallest, tightest thing you can call the golden feature that will tie your hands the least.)

"I Just Need An Estimate"
A "courtesy" estimate

Gantt Chart - don't use it because it looks like it's set in stone
Fat crayon, balsamiq style mocks, that kind of thing

Identify components where you can, 

--------
Series of ranged band estimates (2-4 weeks, minimum and maxiumum)
  - For well-known tasks, you can have a tighter frame
  - for lesser-known tasks, you can have a wider variance to shwo the level of surety
Add up variance
Sort by variance
Highlight that anything over 2 days is a SWAG
Anything over 1 week is SSWAG

What is a "Good Esitamtie"
- 0.5 - 1 day granularity
- known work - based on things that have been done before

Bad Estimates
- Broad chunkcs (2 weeks, etc)


Best Case  -- Mean -- Worst Case
time for each story
If the worst case is close to the mean, you're pretty sure
If you're far away from the mean and worst case, you start having the level of insecurity

Start focusing on the higher priority items in the backlog

Story points vs hours - capturing velocity and ambiguity??
Average story points don't make a lot of sense -- the higher the story point, the higher the ambiguity. You cna't just translate it to hours.

Story points can be used to look back and a few sprints. Those are the kind of story points you can assess and look at the historical data.
If you have the same team, the same codebase. If something changes, you can't ompare as easily.

Story points -- what if you use tee shirt sizes? 
Putting any number down lends the ide that there is a degree os accuracy and certainty.

When a story comes up, you put an estimate band to it (4-8 hours)

Esitmation Approaches (range band, winer filer. maximum likelihood estimators)

Over time, teaching the business to hink with some rigor about their returns from the software they're developing.


How to model opportunity costs and option costs?

It's weird that we're not doing costing associated with backlog items. What's the upside of doing the item? Whats the cost of manintenance? The business peoces that need to support?
Thiink about DSE.

AGile = fixed teams, fixed resources, fixed costs. How do you move around that cost and track the value created from that team?
