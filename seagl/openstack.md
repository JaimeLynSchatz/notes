git-review is a plugin to allow Gerrit to do its thing

You Will Get Feedback
=====================
git commit -a --amend
git review
That's what you do when you've changed something in response to feedback for your patch.

Can you use Gerrit for other things? Is there a way to take Gerrit and still use it to submit things to Github - it keeps your commits clean and version controls your commits.

Openstack has meetups.
