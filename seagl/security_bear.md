Risk management - make choices: the risk is that you will be attacked
Mitigating risk and making choices. The walking vs driving vs bussing at different times of day risk assessment.

Security managers low-probablity events.
Done right, your life is no better (unless it's already really bad.)
If you do it wrong, your life could be much, much worse.

1. Who is the attacker
2. What can they do
3. What are the attack paths
4. What's the timing
5. What's the target

Hello, NSA. The See Everything. Countering them puts your operation on the dark side. Don't. Call the A Team and a lawyer.

*Who are the attackers?*
1. NSA
2. OCR
3. Creeps
4. Low-capability crooks
5. Script Kiddies
6. Teenager Next Door (Ferris Bueller)

*Interest Level*
1. Generic - You exist! That's interesting.
2. Demographic targets (Nerds are targets for bitcoin scams or whatever)
3. Personally targeted: The story of what's his name's friend getting hotel rooms for the Fright Night event and running off with his $$

*Paths*
1. network
2. physical access
3. assault (rubber hose)
4. legal (dmca, etc.)

*Professionalism*
1. 9-5 spy, this is their job
2. occassional, opportunistic
3. everything in between

*Identify Your Assets*
1. Identity
2. Location
3. Computer resouces
4. Blackmail material

*Identify ways to attack them*
1. Identify
a. password protected
2. Location
a. google knows where you are
3. Computer (zombie DDOS computers)
4. Blackmail material (creeps happen)

*What will you pay to deal with the problem*
Payment means time, effort, memory
The cost of payment has to be less than the cost of the attack

Mitigations: Use a differnt password for each site + Use credit cards b/c they have fraud insurance and chargebacks

EMAIL IS A HUGE RISK
====================
It's the typical reset mechanism for nearly every site

*Password Management Tools*
lastpass - eh, not great

*Manual Management*
Texfile for usernames & passwords
apg to generate secure passwords, long passwords

gpg pubkey to secure the file (ugh, it's rough.)

Which is going to hurt less? They're tradeoffs

*Creepers - stalking you on Facebook*
Can socially engineer access to your accounts.

Mitigation
1. Change passwords regularly
2. Privacy settings??
3. Twitter, etc. If the photo can't show up on the front page of the Seattle Times, don't have it online or in the cloud
4. Document everything about the creeper that you learn -- talk to an expert about how to validate this so you can use in court

*Zombie Bot*
Faceless hacker wants your info, your stuff, etc.
Shellshock - ACK
Much of this you can't control - servers you visit, etc.

Mitigation
1. Disable flash (set up for click-to-play)
2. Same for Java
3. Don't click word emails
4. Ask your favorite web hosts for SSL* everywhere*

check out Someone who cares - it's a redirect list to block things out,
check it out, though. It could be interesting

tunnelbear.com has a free plan for encrypting comminitcation
============================================================


Someone steals your laptop

Full disk encryption
1. It's slow
2. Don't lose the key

*TAILS*
Don't save anything on the computer

Do all your work on the cloud -
ummm, only if you trust whoever has that server you're storing to


**Partner Spying**
physical access, keylogger, cameras, demands access

Mitigation
1. Talk to an advocate or trusted friend
2. Get a new phone (burner phone)
3. Use libary computer for new account with 2FA
4, New accounts for records
5. Physically secure devices
6. No ties to old accounts or phone numbers

**Review operationsal security practicies**

**Review what you have, how much do you care?**
**Make choices about your tradeoffs**
**Methodically implement methods to reduce risk of harm**
**Prepare for the attacker who cares more than you do**

Security is broken - make choices about whatyou care about fixing a bit

Would recommend internal and external pen testing


?? Google Authenticator - how does that work? It's generate on the 
***HOTTP - what is that? Look it up...***
