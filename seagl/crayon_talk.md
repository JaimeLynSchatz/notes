What if there's a machine that writes Crayon?

French UNIX?

Tricking people who think they can't program into programming by having them translate keywords and libraries.
Teaching tool to get folks to realize ANYONE can program and think logically.

Translating the _meaning_ of the word, not just the word.
Translating "bear"
First you need to define what bear (or, rather, _which_ bear)
Then you know what to use as the word to be translated.

Turning this into a genral purpose programming language sounds a lot like reinventing the web browser but for Crayon.
A Crayon Browser.

Katahdin Language
SEaton

(extending the language with the language -- like the Youtube guy talking about defining words before you use them)


Is this the next step after Scratch and Minecraft programming? this appears to be better than things like Processing and whatever the heck they taught the girls at DigiGirlz.
And if it translates to Python ... that means arduino. Can you push that?? Or is Python just easier? Is Crayon actually easier?
