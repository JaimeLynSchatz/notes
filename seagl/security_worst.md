Security Worst Practices
========================

He talked about the what's in your arsenal - that was the technical talk. Perhaps slides or something you can find...

***Case Studies***

The keypad locks on restrool stalls

Worst Practices
===============
* Expect end=users to forgo convenience in place of security
* Lock down the infrastrcture so tightly, that getting work done becomes very difficult
* Focus on preventative mechanisms while ignoring detective controls
* Assume your patch management process is working, without checking on it
* Stop learning about technoligies and attacks
* Don't cross-train your IT and security staff - they need to understand that they're each on the same team
* Assume that your useds will read the policy becasie you asked them
* Using standard seciruty templates without customizing them
* Creating policies that you cannot enforce
* Enforce policices that are not properly approved
* Create a security policy just a mark in a checkbox
* Make sure none of the employees finds the policies
* Assume that if the policies worked for you last year, they will continue to work
* Assumet hat being compliant means you're secure (that's like saying approved by the FDA)
* Assume that policies don't apply to executives
* Hide from the auditors

Loging Issues
=============
* Not logging
* Not looking at the logs
* Storing the logs for a short time
* Prioritizing the logs before collection
* Ignore logs from applications
* Approaching logging in a siloed manner - if they're centralized, it's easier to anazyse together

Logging tools: seagan, prelude lml (log monitoring lackey),
Test logs like they're part of the program (they are)

Database Worst Practices
========================
* Leave the db software unpatched
* Let rogue dbs proliferate like dandelions
* Grant excessive privileges
* Leave username/pswd at default settings
* STick your head in the sand with regard to what users are doing, how the databases are being used, and what kinds of attacks the database is vulnerable to
* Allow arbitrary connections and user input
* Leaving the database unencrypted

You can pay now or pay later with security.

Passwords
=========
Require your uses to change passwords too frequently
* Expect your users to remember password without writing them down
* Impose overly-onerous password selection requirements
* Use the same password in systems that differ in risk exposure of data cricality.

ANY SUGGESTIONS FOR HOW TO COPE WITH THAT

Passwords and toothbrushes have a lot in common
don't share
they wear out after a period of time

Backups
=======
* backup run time? whatevs
* assume that what needs backing up today is the same as tomorrow
* run backups manually
* only run backups now and they "when something has changed"
* Offsite? Not in your car or in your house
* physically secure your offsite backups
* don't kreep resusing your tapes - they wear out
* you don't test your backups

Small Businesses
================
* I'm too small to be hacked
* Leave websites ope to SQL injections
* Fail to patch or securely configure systems
* Let software licenses lapse
* utilize poos passwords
* let employees browse the web unchecked
* fail to train employees




od Security Practices
=====================
Five Golden Principles
1. know your system
* what runs on it, who are the users, network setup
* the network is the system, network traffic, usage patterns
** what systems should be on your network
** what systems connect
** what's the good softwre
** what's the bad software out there
2. Principle of Least Privlege
3. Defense in Depth
4. Prevention is key but detection is a must
