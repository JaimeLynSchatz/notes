#It Doesn't Have to Be Hideous!

Go Kristy!! :)

Everyone needs a little design skills.

We're not aiming for _good_, we're aiming for _fine_.

Design and usability are associated, but NOT THE SAME THING.

##Rule 0: Hire Someone Else to Do it

##Composition
##Rule 1: Be Consistent
*Font sizes
*Color themes
*Spacing, etc.

###Rule 2: Like Attracts Like
Group the things that are related metaphorically so they are together visually.

Blank space is ok -- it draws attention to what's inside it.

###Rule 3:
Align all the Things!
Center is a coward's alignment.

Just like furniture, don't shove it all against the walls.

###Rule 4: Fibonacci all the things!
Pay attention to the proportions of things

Font size 3:5, 5:8, 55:89, etc.
That will keep it balanced.

Grid sizes, too.
(turn the outlines on so you can see what's happening)

##Constructions
###Rule 5: Less
There should always be less
You should be able to take your glasses off an still understand what you're looking at
If you're using the space well, you can use fewer words to convey what is happening

Mon instead of Monday
Name or Podcast instead of Alarm.PodcastName

Icons on buttons instead of words on buttons

###Rule 6: Fonts -- Pick 2, Choose Wisely
Here there be dragons.

Don't use default fonts.
Times New Roman? Forget it exists.

**Serif fonts are great for paper or for reading lots of text**
Prose, newspaper articles, big chunks of body text

**Sans-serif**
Good for screens, headlines, etc.

**Script Fonts**
They're a condiment -- don't use it for lots of words
Be very intentional, very sparingly

**Stupid Fonts**
Don't. Just don't.
Stupid fonts are the parsley garnish.
No handwriting fonts (no comic sans)
It feels friendly.
Go with sans serif.

[https://fonts.google.com](Google Fonts)
Pick a chunky font for the headlines, then a smaller serif for paragraphs and body texts.
Or, pick one font and use different weights.

###Fonts differ in
Width, 

###Rule 8: Color

Cool colors fade into the background -- you can use more of them to accomplish the same effect.
Warm colors jump out at you - you need less of them to accomplishthe same effect.

###Rule 9: Icons
See rules 0 an 1
If you can buy it, do so. Don't build it yourself.
And be consistent: make sure the icons are consistent with the font and wth eachother
