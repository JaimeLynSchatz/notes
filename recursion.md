#Recursion
There are different mental models for recursion.

The "copies" model is the one held by experts. That's the one i want to teach and develop a physical model for.

##Recursion Topics:

• A description of the active flow of control. CHAPTER 4. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS 39 • A mention of changing parameter values or breaking the problem into smaller instances of the same problem. • A mention of the base case. • A description of the passive flow of control and how the solution is built up in reverse

Prerequisite to understanding recursion: a good grasp of parameter passing.
