Barry Barrister

Barry Barrister is a public defender and has practiced law for the last thirty-five years. He uses paper files as much as possible and has, until very recently, resisted the digitization efforts at her public interest law firm.

Barry's paralegal recently showed him the results from a study of demography and incarceration rates in NYC and now wants to use his own (recently digitized) case data to look for similar patterns. In his files, demographic information is stored in one file, with sentencing information in another.

Barry has taken some basic computer skill classes but is _not_ comfortable with computers. He is both concerned about "breaking the d--n thing" and about the potential security risks of having his client's data and his own work product on a computer and not "safely" filed away on yellow legal pads.
