App ideas:
Build a C# app that lets you add pantry-like items to your shopping list. You can manage one main list, add categories for what store you can find it in and then filter by what store you're in. If you're in Fred Meyers, you see all kinds of thing
If you're in Bartell's or Rite Aid you get drug store items.
