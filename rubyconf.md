Without Hogwarts, where would the Magical (and Muggle) worlds be?  
A few years ago, the Magical world faced a threat like no other. Two of the three wizards (and witch) who led us out of that darkness were not raised in the magical world. Schools like Hogwarts can help us identify and train those with innate magical talents and interests whom we might otherwise never discover.  
But how do find and teach those who are beyond the reach of our owls? This talk seeks to explore our options and will serve as a call to action for the Magical world.
