Host of the week posts on twitter a reminder and a tweety thing afterwards

Keep an eye on the numbers as we grow. Fizzy drinks in the "Beer fridge"?? Stay low key on the snacks, but make sure there's a little nosh on the discussion days. Nosh and Nash? Snack and Chat?

Cheri will send out a Doodle on the Sundays. Sept and Oct first. :D Yeay!
