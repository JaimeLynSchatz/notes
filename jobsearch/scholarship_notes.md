I've been self-studying Ruby, Ruby on Rails, HTML/CSS, JavaScript and a smattering of Python and PHP before/after work for the last two years. I am currently interning with Wikimedia through the Gnome Outreach Project for Women, working on the Open Historical Streetmap project. I have also applied to the Ada Developers Academy in Seattle. Additionally, I'm working with Cheri Allen and Christina Thompson (both of whom I met at Ada After Hours) to assist with GDISeattle study group sessions.

My interview for Ada is next week. (*fingers crossed*) My plan B is to continue with the online curriculum on http://theodinproject.com and various courses on MITx, et al. Pay-for-play code schools and boot camps are out of my reach financially.

I'm positively giddy at the prospect of attending some of the sessions listed on the website. There are so many awesome people presenting! Having the opportunity meet more people IRL is really exciting, as well. I do most of my learning at home and it can be very isolating.

I've done a lot of things (boathand on the SS Pioneer at the South Street Seaport in New York, wanna-be actress, stage manager, fundraising assistant at Carnegie Hall, paralegal, ...). None of them excite me as much as coding. :)

I only one cat, but I also have three children, a senile dog and a husband in QA (who relishes breaking my code.)

I'm not really an extrovert, but I play one on tv. JK

Having kids and many of my jobs have required that I play the role of extrovert. I'm actually TERRIFIED of walking in to new situations.

A very simple thank you for seeking to broaden the Ruby community in this way. Whether I am selected for a scholarship or not, I'll still think you rock!! :D
