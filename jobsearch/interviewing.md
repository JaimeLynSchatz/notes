The Way of the Weasel
=====================
Weasel your way in
Informational interviews, get referrals

*Same old, same old*
1. Ask questions (duh)
2. Study up on the company (duh) Talk about what they do in the same terms they do.
3. Who are you meeting? Names, titles. ASK. It's ok to ASK. Don't make assumptions. (Remember what they tell you, though.)
4. Think BEFORE you answer. It's ok to have some prepared answers. *Some*. Come up with a "thinking pause" comment (hm, no-one's ever asked me that before or whatever) but not for every question

*Ok, The Meat*
1. SELF CONFIDENCE
a. You're selling yourself. You're awesome. Let everyone know how awesome you are.
2. Let what's awesome about you shine through.
a. Do NOT be overly modest in an interview. No-one is. No-one.
3. ***If you're not striking out in interviews, you're not aiming high enough. Keep batting.***

1. Can you do the job
2. Will you like doing the job
3. Can we stand working with you?

***Doing the Job***
1. Open-ended questions will have 100s of correct answers
2. man -df is the right answer

***Will you like doing this job***
1. They don't want you to quit in 3 months.

***Being tolerable to work with***
1. Don't be a jerk. Don't be racist. (!!OMG needs to be said??)
2. Are you passionate about the tools (but don't be a zealot.)


If the interviewer is terrible at it, help them fix it.
Bad question? Give your answer and get to the distlled question behind the bad question.
***Put your best foot forward.***
Be polite, but it helps to have a little control over the conversation.

Highlight what you did - talk about your own contributions (not just "my team did blah blah blah."

Don't be authoritatively wrong. Don't just make it up.

"I don't know, but if I had to guess..."
========================================

Obnoxious Interview Questions
=============================
1. Prepare some answers
2. What's your greatest weakness - don't give in to the invitation to shoot yourself in the foot.
a. Not just the whole "I'm really loud" thing.
b. List an actual weakness and say what you're doing to improve on it.
3. Can you give me an example of a time you had to/did _________________?
a. Have some stories prepared
4. Read my mind and tell me what I'm thinking. -- make a good attempt to answer this without sarcasm.

Salary Negotiations
===================
***This should not happen during an interview***
Only when you have an offer in hand, do your best to ensure that you aren't the first person to name a number.
1. When they ask for your current salary
"Well I'm not really comfortable talking about my current salary, because it's not related to what I'm doing now."
2. If you must, remember his padding number.
3. Use Glassdoor.com and Salary.com to see what the "market average" is for your skill set
a. Get away from being a commodity to being a talent.

Interviews are a Two-Way Street
===============================
1. You are also interviewing the company.
2. You don't have to take the job they offer you
(think about Ada students, Liz and what Renee said.)

PRACTICE
========
Go for jobs you really want

go for roles you can get

don't dress to impress, dress not to offend

Act like someone they would like to work with every day

Repeat as required.

Do you have any questions for me
================================
You keep asking questions. Questions, questions, questions.
1. What is it you're looking to see in a candidate that you haven't seen yet.
This lets you reassure doubts they might have

Movement is imperative for job growth. Interviewing is a skill. Practice.

Find some bridge roles to transition to another career path
You can tell a lot about a company by the way they buy their people

Exploding offers: if they want an answer this second, high pressure
Tell them you're looking at other offers and would like a few days to consider their offer.  Barest minimum: let me sleep on it.

What will it take to make you work here: pick a number that would be ridiculous if they took it.
If they give you a number, your job is to count to ten, look at the page, say "hmmm. is this the best you can do?" Then DON"T SPEAK. The next person who speaks LOSES.
Negotiate politely and in good faith.
If they don't like that you stood up for yourself, is that really the kind of company 

Never give an answer on the spot. When it's high enough-ish, you now need to decide.

Read up on the art of negotiating a salary. Salary negotiation study

Cool. Thank you, NOt to be too negative, what's your least favorite part of working here? Then look at their body language, really listen to them.


***Can you describe the workflow of a typical day?***
