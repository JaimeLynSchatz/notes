Something to consider with client rendering is the vast array of graphical ability in the clients. Expecting too much of the client will render (dysqidt?) the website unusable. See the intro on (http://www.farbrausch.de/~fg/da/diplom_print.pdf) for details.

Initial reading would indicate that OHM is a good candidate for client-side rendering. Large number of clients with some interactive visual elements (but nothing like what is required for a 3D game, for instance.)  Server side rendering could be unmanageable with an increase in popularity.

Client side rendering does require a level of "programming to the lowest common denominator", though. But can that be managed? Moore's law and all, clients are going to get better all the time (and may change formats, too, but that's a whole other story.)

Yahoo has patented a method of client-side vector rendering: https://www.google.com/patents/US7734412. Still trying to grok the patent info. It's rather dense.
