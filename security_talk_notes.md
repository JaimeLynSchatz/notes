Authentication as a microservice at instantiation

Identity federation

Authorization at retrieval

Audit trail needs to includes authorization attempts (success and fail)
You'll be in a better place in the instance of a breach if you can piece together what happened.

If you can verify in the audit trail that a bug was never exploited then you don't need to publicly announce the bug. You just fix it.

Don't call it AUTH
It's authentication and authorization with audit control
