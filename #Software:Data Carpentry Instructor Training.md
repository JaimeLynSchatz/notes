#Software/Data Carpentry Instructor Training

Defining _novice_ - doesn't know where the cookbook is
Defining the path from novice to competent practitioner
_competent practitioner_ - reads the cookbok, has a few go-to recipes memorized
_expert_ - is writing a new cookbook, fluid switching between different mental models (algebraic and geometric representations, etc.)

###The Git Parable

Do you need to understand every detail to understand it enough to use it?
That's the tabs-spaces debate in techincal education

You need to learn how to walk before you learn to run, but you don't need to learn how Na and K ions make your muscles work to learn to walk.

Help a novice build a mental model that makes sense to them. It doesn't have to be the same mental model you have (or that an expert would have.) As learners move up through the steps, they will build new models.

Teaching principles through specific commands as examples.

###Assessments - check the validity of the model
####Formative Assessment
_Hands-on_
A method to assess the mental models learners are constructing
Provides guidance to instroctor and learner what to focus on.
*Multiple Choice Questions* are a good option for determining factual errors or to identify the existance of a broken model

####Summative Assessment
- The exam at the end to evaluate what a learner has absorbed

* Factual misconceptions (NYC is the capital of NY)
* Model issues (need to understand _why_ the learner believes this is the case)

*Peer learning*
When some folks have a working model, but others do not, peer learning can be useful


*Write a multiple choice question*

Resist the tempation to put in nonsense questions. Every single answer should give you information on the mental model of the learner
Let the wrong answers tell you what went wrong in the learner's mind. No need to put the student on the spot: "You got it wrong - what were you thinking?"

_frequent formative assessments_
5 - 15 minutes to get folks to exercise the mental models they're forming

###Expertise
What's a field of expertise for you, and what's something you're _not_ an expert in. What's different in the way you think about it.

It's important to remember you've got a bunch of implicit knowledge that you're not even aware of that it's important to get that knowledge into your learner's fingers and eyes, as well. (Know what part of the error message is important, spaces between flags, all kinds of things.)

_Beware the expert blind spots._ You can't remember what it was like to have a mental model that didn't have the same connections you have.
That's the benefit of teaching something you're not yet an expert at.
And _resist the temptation to build fluid mental models_
and watch out for the word _just_ -- "You _just_ " do this super complicated thing that the learners don't even understand what you're saying.

It's not a study of computer science -- SWC is teaching specific tools for their day-to-day work.

"You are not your learners." They won't necesarily every particularly enjoy learning. They're looking for a way to get their "real" work done. This isn't Railsbridge or ADA.

####Memory Management Extensions/Tools
_Chunking_  (the student who remembers 10 digit numbers as running times)
Chunking together mutliple concepts together into meaningful chunks

_Concept Maps_
Map out the concepts, draw arrows between the elements then count what you have. That's theoretically one chunk, BUT if you've got too many elements and relationships between the elements, you neeed to break it down further so you've got a smaller chunk to build from.
Example with the for loop
It helps you break down your own mental model so you can find your spots
consider the arrows as actions and the boxes as nouns

Drawing on paper or on a whiteboard invites collaboration. Drawing in mindmap software or something fancy shuts down discussion.

Concept mapping can help you find the expert blindspots -- if you're only thinking of a process or concept as a pipeline or flow chart, you're missing the explanation of the _why_ something is happening.

consider: what do you want the learner to take away from the concept you're teaching here?
Look for _missing concepts_ -- What are the pre-requisites to the concept you're seeking to dive into?

###Cognitive Load Theory
Intrinsic load (what' you have to keep in mind)
Germaine load (the learning you're doing right now)
Extraneous load (distractions)

As you're providing examples, slowly remove bits of the scaffolding so that learners need to depend more on the germaine cognitive load
*"Faded example* -- slowly fade away parts of the example.

*Parses exercises*
Give the learner all the lines in the program and have them put things in the right order
Focus on what you're trying to teach -- give them the for loop structure, for example, so they can fill in the germaine areas.

###Minute Cards
Love, love, love the way SWC uses the sticky notes (blue sticky note, red sticky note) Provide immediate feedback during the episodes, and then used at hte end of each quarter of the class to provide comments.

Self-reflect: what have you learned?

###Motivation/De-motivation
You're a learner, too - tells your larners it's ok to not know everything
Set the rules of the environment
_beware feigning surprise_
making mistakes or misunderstanding is part of the learning process
Folks are intrinsically motivated when they can see how it's useful to them
*know your audience*

_Other Strategies to Build Learner Motivation_
Build in ways to pick up extra exercies and such
Demonstrating your own motivation is helpful

What motivates you to teach? (answers in the etherpad)

Pacing: it's better to not get to the very end of the lesson than to rush through and not have folks understanding
When helping: _let them drive_ do *not* put your hands on the keyboard

Look out for ", right?" - it's like adding "just." It's a bit like feigning surprise. Very, very demotivating.

Watch out for people who are waay beyond the curriculum -- table their questions. "That's really interesting -- let's talk about that at the end." Or maybe designate them as a helper.

####If there is a lot of disparity in understanding in the class, feel free to turn lessons into pairing exercises (especially if folks are spread out a bit)

_imposter syndrome_
_stereotype threat_
These can both draw from your attention and make it difficult to learn.

Improving accessiblity for one group of people improves accessibility for many others.

ELA - English learners - how to avoid idioms or metaphors that can be very language-specific. What can we do??
Use simple language when you can, don't bring in a metaphor or analogy if it's not necessary. Or, paraphrase _using different words_

###Mindset (Growth vs. Set)
"Born mathematician", "born teacher", etc.
_growth mindset!_

####What Questions Do You Have?
*not*
Do you have any questions?
Then just stand there and let people ask questions.


###Learner Profiles
Similar to a user profile - who are they, what aretheir deets, why are they taking the workship, etc...
Write it down, try to take their point of view

###Learning Objectives
Like TDD - what are the questions you want to answer by the end of the lesson?
Explicit, testable, express in a sentence that has a verb
Useful both for designing a lesson or for preparing for teaching a lesson

###Live Coding
To avoid split attention:
* Say what you're doing to type
* Say what you're typing
* Then say what you just typed

##TODO
Check out Keycaster
Look at what the screen looks like from the back of the room
SET UP A TEACHING DISPLAY MODE FOR YOUR MAC
- SIMPLE PS1, BIG FONT, WHITE BACKGROUND, REALLY SIMPLE AND EASY TO READ


Addressed the red postit
walks through each step during and after live coding
Addressed all the cons in last session
explained the one-line after arrowing up
didn't ask for questions

Be enthusiastic - be yourself
Feel free to move around, point things out on the screen, write on the white board
Wrte down the shell or Git, etc. commands you're teaching on the whiteboard so there's a reference 

####Demonstrate an authentic workflow once you're there
Do what's useful so they can internalize that

###Final Quarter (!)
Introductions: set the etone for a brief workshop. First impressions MATTER
####Introduce yourself and intros go around
Build trust between you and the learners (and amongst the learners)
Establish you've been a learner, but don't be too self-deprecating (you need to demonstrate competency to teach it)
Why are you teaching? What's your motivation, etc. How does that matter to the learners.
Don't start with negatives: I've never taught this workshop before, I hate git, etc.

My Introduction
Hi, my name is Jaime Schatz. I work as a business analyst with a software consultancy here in Seattle where I'd like to teach the world to code.
I have no idea what to write here. 

####Objectvies of the Workshop
The broad goal of the Carpentries
Pre-workship surveys can inform this
Describe (high level) the work
Code of conduct
Talk about how you will ask for feedback
Coffee, restrooms, etc. Basic structure of day?

###The Carpentries
Greg Wilson and Software Carpentry

TODO: Instructors List from the Carpentries mailing list
Find the Slack channel, too

###Workshops
Central vs. Self-organized
$2500 vs $500
Self-organizing will still be listed on the website and want to know how many learners are going to attend (and how many actually did attend)

Self-organizing:
- have a certified instructor (at least one, doesn't need to be all)
- teach "core" (SWC: version control, shell, programming; DC: data organization, something from the DC website)
- pre + post asessments
- send Carpentry a summary of what you did (who taught, how many, where, etc.)


##TODO: Make a contribution to the carpentries repros (comment on an issue, something) (check out swc-gapminder or something -- there are lots of lessons laid out)
##TODO: get really good at this lesson: https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/

Managing the diverse set of experience/educational backgrounds
Setting expectations for the class ahead of time can help work around this
Creating/adopting advanced options for the challenges
If you have enough helpers, you can have a helper monitor the chat window (especially for large groups) - have learners with questions post questions in the chat window of the etherpag

"By staying here now, you're agreeing to the code of conduct" -- maybe figure out how to word that better. (Listen closely to how other groups handle it.)
If you do have to act on a code of conduct violoation, go to poliicies group on swcarpentry (send an email to confidential@carpentry.org)

###New Steps
####Check-out Procedure (https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/checkout/)
1. Make a contribution to the SWC github websites
Look for one of the issues that says "PR" needed
Lesson diagrams are great (svg) to help explain someting and email link when submitted checkout@carpentries.org


2. Participate in a discussion: http://pad.software-carpentry.org/instructor-discussion

3. Teach a short demonstration lesson - don't sign up for one that Ariel is running
Be prepared to walk through the entire lesson - the proctor will tell you where to start. You'll share your screen, get feedback on the etherpad
http://pad.software-carpentry.org/teaching-demos

Create an etherpad with http://pad.software-carpentry.org/ (automatically created for your workshop)
