Questions:

The microtask: Was that what you were looking for? I spent a lot of time just getting a handle on what is happening with map tile rendering (my background in graphics is nonexistent) and the vast amounts of info on the OSM wiki. I found rabbit hole after rabbit hole, not sure if I went down the right one (or went far enough.)

I've been lurking in freenode/#ohm but when I asked a question there last night, they seemed to think I was in the wrong place. Am I?

How often should I be checking in with you? Where? On Google Chat? Through posting in the GitHub issues? 

For how long do you want me to wrestle with issues before I ask? An hour? A day? Longer?
