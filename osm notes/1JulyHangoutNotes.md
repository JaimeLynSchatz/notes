Very rough notes for July 1 OHM Hangout

-wikimedia foundation map namespace
-raster layers in there already?
-wikimania - is that a joke name or a real name for a conference?
-a new mailing list? Susanna will send out an invite to everyone
-must get headphones with a mic for these calls
-wikimania is a conference - 10 year anniversary of Wikimedia?? Trying to follow what they're talking about
-Susanna made a survery - link will follow, newsletter

- What to do with search:
**Map warper, search that finds maps in the warper based on their location
Changes done are minor tweaks to the user interface
Step 2, make the search extend to images on the commons that have a location of some sort
A person on the team who works on the wikimedia side of things - not necessarily Foundation, but has to be someone who is knowledgable of the structutres of MediaWiki projects
Who would we talk to?
Third step: What can be done to link Wikidata or other data to provide to the map? And then expand to the world.

this form has the time range/time inpute that Susanna wants
Start simple, get more complex
Steps, reasonable plan that works - 
Searching for maps in the Warper - how do  we search? Type, description,

After searching for a map from the warper, maybe a histogram? A list - sorted? Of the maps that come up with the search

The scale of the maps - country level is sometimes requested but the Ide doesn't work on that scale. not always working on the street level, sometimes on the county level. Is that something that the hobbyist would be doing? Or can they use existing resources for this.

Digitize at the streetlevel and then pull them together? - side note

STEP 1:  Work on the survey - it's long and will take some time.

STEP 2: The Search
Start discussing search tonight on the mailing list

Jeph - getting familiar with the documents, working with a Wikimedian developer, will take on the task of doing a bunch of the front end changes. He's big on the UX.  Susanna will work as an extra hand 

Database of height maps. Gives topological information from shuttle data - taken from space? Current open data for Finland available somewhere.

Hack for Norway - placing images in a 3D space. secondtake.eu

Historical maps as a way for governments to ensure that they are storing their maps forever.Could ensure the OSM platform's future - dealing with backups and stable infrastructure
Colocated data in a bomb shelter.

Digital Humanities conference with geo data - Susanna is speaking on this. Not a lot of info about the Wikidata community and where they are with all of this.

WHAT DO ACADEMICS WANT OUT OF OHM
ADHO 

Discussion of Wikidata-Wikimaps talk

GitHub - Which repository? Tim's been working in the Warper repo, issues are in their own general issues space (so much discussion wouldn't fit with just one repo).
