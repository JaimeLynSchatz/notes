#Things I Wish I'd Learned in Code School
_@nextlevelbanana

##Highlighting the gaps between Code School and Work

A good place to start, obviously not a good place to stop

###1. Any Compiled Language
The code school focused on all scripted langues. Nothing compiled.
C#, Java, C++/C, anything!

####_Why?_
*Expands possible career options
  *Code camp taught how to be a web developer
*Coser to the 1s and 0s
  *Closer to thinking like the computer
  *Understanding the way that a computer works turns out to be really useful
*You might love it!

####_How?_
*Head First C# (also a Java and a Design Patterns)
*Koans (like [https://excercism.io](exercism) )
*Get bored, make app
  *Learn by doing -- if you don't know what to make, build a clone of something "My Twitter", etc.)

###2. A Real IDE

####_Why?_
*You might love it
*Takes time to learn
  *Try it before your first day on the job
  *It's a learn all the time kind of thing

####_How?_
*Download one
*Start making that app!
*Press ALL the buttons -- before you're on the job!

###3. How to Change Someone Else's Code
In code school, you can keep your whole app in your head

####_Why?_
*Most code is written by someone else
*And that someone else might not 
*Legacy apps exist and you will need to learn how to go in and change it without breaking it
*And how to assess whether you're even breaking it!

####_How?_
*Volunteer: Nonprofits, Github, etc. (_WordPress_, anybody?)
*Clone a repo and step through it with breakpoints until it makes sense

*Open Seattle*, OpenHatch,*
*Python Playground -- convert programs to new languages*

###4. The Value of the Official Documentation
Not StackOverflow, but the real, official docs

####_Why?_
*Definitive answers for how it works
*All the fun of reading the dictionary
  *Once you learn all the abbrevs and how it's all organized
  *The serendipity of discovering new features

####_How?_
*[https://docs.microsoft.com](Microsoft)
*[https:developer.mozilla.org](Mozilla)

_Start with something you already understand so that you can learn how the information is structured_

_It's OK to ASK!_

###5. The First Thing About DevOps
What happens after the code runs on your machine? In the real world, that is only step one.

Minifying, build tools, automating steps

####_Why?_
It will probably be your problem.

####_How?_
*Put that app on Github
*Now get that code on Heroku
  *Don't panic, _don't despair_ This might take a while to get it actually working!
*Bonus: transform it midstream with a script
  *Here's my code, I want to minify my JS and CSS on the way
  *Here's my test suite, I want to run it trhough the tests before I push it up

###6. Production Versus ...Not
Works on my machine doesn't work yet
Production environment, development environment, test, staging, etc.

####_Why?_
Production is radioactive
Limit your exposure. It's safer that way.

####_How?_
*Set up an intermediate environment for your app my_heroku_app_staging
*Add a feature, put it up in staging before putting it in production

###7. Working With a Product Owner
In school. you have a person who knows what you want in the app

####_Why?_
"I have altered the requirements. Pray I do not alter them further."

####_How?_
Make a thing for someone else.
"Pair" with someone.

###8. The Agile Catechism
The cadence, the rythmn of work. You might still find some people who don't work this way.
Short chunks of well-defined bits of work.

####_Why?_
To decide your level of devotion.
You need to know how much you like it and need it in a job, because everyone does it a little differently.
So you can make sure your styles line up so you don't get stuck in a cadence that doesnt fit your style.

####_How?_
*Read about it
*Plan a party using these methods

The more stuff you can make, the better.
