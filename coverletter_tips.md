"1) When applying to a job or internship, it's a great idea to write a cover letter.  When I applied to the internship at the startup, I submitted a cover letter even though it wasn't required.  It only took me an hour to write, but I later found out that the letter is what got me the internship.  My manager thought that the cover letter was "brilliant."  Apparently, he only gets 1 cover letter with every 10 resumes he receives, and out of those cover letters, only 1 out of 5 is interesting.  So if you write a great cover letter, that puts you in the top 2%.  The method I used to write my cover letter was

a) to anticipate questions I'd be asked in a job interview (things that would make them hesitate to hire me) and answer them in the letter 
b) to describe my understanding of the company's market, what the company was trying to achieve, the challenges they faced, and why I thought all that was interesting
c) the regular, expected material about why I was qualified for the job"
